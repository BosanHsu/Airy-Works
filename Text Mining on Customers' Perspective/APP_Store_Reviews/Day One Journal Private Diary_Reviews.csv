I write on my iPad quite a bit and love to use slide-over and split-screen views to jot down thoughts in my journal while I am reading my Kindle book in the background. Hard to believe that Day One still craps out once you hit one full page of content within the app. Once you finish writing a full-page in slide-over or split-screen view, you can no longer see what you are writing because the app stops scrolling with your writing. You are writing “blind” so to speak. It is really hard to believe that this problem still persists after all these years and has frustrated me on more than one occasion. Simple problem - please fix this for the love of all that is good and holy."

I wish there was a way that I could have my Spotify playlist linked up to Day One so that it would sync with what I was listening to at the time while writing my entry. So I thought this option would work however it doesn’t work. I updated the app. I looked at all my settings on my iPhone and it does not work. I don’t know if this is a feature that is not working? I have the premium subscription too so I don’t know why it’s not working. It’s become incredibly annoying.. to try to figure it out."

My entire life has been recorded here and that’s really special… but this new main page layout is AWFUL. You removed all color and it’s just boring and ugly. Please please please bring back the old main page!!!"

liiz7,11355104509,2024-06-07T13:46:16-07:00,5,I don’t like how they took away the underline I was using it a lot but maybe I’m missing it or people don’t use it bummer :/
PandaEyes87,11352473899,2024-06-06T22:10:03-07:00,4,"I know some users aren’t happy about DayOne’s new user update and how the UI looks very different now. It’s understandable that not everyone may like it. Personally, I liked the older UI much better, but am willing to give this new layout a fair try. 

Things might be a bit buggy and wonky while we all try to adapt to this new layout, but I’m sure those other things will be taken care of in time.

 I’ve been searching around for another journal app to use and nothing still comes close to DayOne. In my opinion, this is still the best journaling app out there and as long as they don’t continue to change things that make the app less user friendly and away from the original intentions of the app, I’m still willing to stick with them. 

Even when they do big updates like these that kind of has everyone mad about the change. As long as I try to get used to the change, then I think I will feel better about it later on."
venusamaris,11352062949,2024-06-06T19:04:40-07:00,3,"Updated to add: I do not love this new version. I have been using this app for years now. I always like the touches of color on the screen. Now they have stripped away nearly all the color. Why? It is so sterile and boring, and I honestly do not see the reason for the change. Were people complaining that it was too colorful. I kind of doubt that. Change for the sake of change is always a bad idea. Nothing about this latest update has improved my experience in using it. Learn to leave a good thing alone instead of messing it up in pursuit of a “fresh new look”.

Updated to add: I love the new location function in the latest update, it was just what I was hoping for. The developers are obviously trying hard to be responsive to users. They did not ""abandon iCloud"" here or charge money for an update. This is a NEW VERSION of Day One, and if you want to use it you will have to pay all of $5 - $10 (!), and learn to live with their excellent sync service. If you love the classic Day One, keep using it. It is not going away, or being abandoned. If you want iCloud sync, stick with the Classic version, do not expect this version to meet that need. The developers have done everything possible to communicate the fact that iCloud and Dropbox would not be available in v2, and why. It makes sense to me, and if I really want to keep using iCloud sync I can stick with Day One Classic. I recommend going to the developer website and reading their blog post from a week or so ago, which outlines why the changes and what they see as the benefit of using Day One Sync instead of iCloud. I have used Day One for a few years now, and I have always loved it. Journaling is very important in my life, I have done it since I was a kid and I have boxes of paper journals archived away. The original Day One was my go-to journal from the first day I downloaded it. I was a bit worried about the impending upgrade, I tip my hat to the developers of Day One for doing it right."
Clemfam,11351676167,2024-06-06T16:20:39-07:00,3,Date lookup feature seems to have disappeared. Why all the updates—so much to continually get used to?
Stdartbos,11349951178,2024-06-06T06:25:13-07:00,1,"I have loved this app for 7 years. Makes it so easy to stay on top of journaling. But I have a complaint for the first time ever here. I hate the latest update. Bring back the top bar that shows my streak, entries on this day, etc. Why take that away? It ruins the main interface. I hate it."
K'lyn Paris,11349426160,2024-06-06T03:31:58-07:00,1,"I miss being able to see the different colors for the different journals. Now all the journals are white and almost indistinguishable from each other. Having one icon at the bottom showing a color to indicate a particular journal is awful.

Put the control buttons back at the bottom where they were. They were easier to access and made more sense.

This latest update seems to be “change for change’s sake,” rather than needed functionality improvements."

Ive used this since 2015 and today i have a sync error and need to enter my ‘encryption key’ WHAT????
So i looked through help and roughly speaking… sorry if you don’t have it tgere is ‘nothing Day One can do’ okay day one, im sire you’ll say its my fault for not ‘writing down ‘ some dumb A key from 8 years ago. 
It is my fault for trusting you. 
The worst paid app experience i ever had. Thanks for wasting entries ive had for 8 years.

I have no idea whats going on at Day Ine with the UI changes, but trust me on this.
Use “the free IOS journal."

User4813,11348614753,2024-06-05T21:27:33-07:00,1,"Well I’m only 10 mins into writing in this app and already found a major issue. I’m typing some pretty emotional stuff and for whatever reason, I guess a slight movement of my phone, the app tries to go in landscape mode and just shows a completely jacked up display (unusable or distinguishable screen the app is displaying since it glitched out trying to switch the orientation). Nothing makes it go back to normal so I close the app completely and open it back up. And just like that the last few minutes of writing are gone. That might not seem like a big deal but when you’re just pouring into something, it’s coming from the heart, you’re not thinking about remembering what you just typed. Why would you even make the app to do that? How is that even possible? Does your app just “save” every couple minutes? Even something as simple as the Notes app that comes with the phone has never done that - once you type it it’s there regardless of when or how quick you close the app. So right there I just didn’t like the experience and am going to look for another app. Completely throws off the experience and now you can’t even trust the app to do the most basic of things - save what you wrote."

Carrie48,11347138651,2024-06-05T11:30:51-07:00,2,"As the title says. I’ve been a user of dayone for 4 years now and have done an entry for every day since I started. I really love the app, however the new UI change is confusing and generally bad — I really enjoyed the old tab where you could see the daily streaks plus the color coded bars helped me know which journal I was in. Also, I have to click in twice to see the “on this day tab” when I’d much prefer it to be fixed above my entries. 

Like many other reviewers mentioned, the book tab seems slightly redundant. I hope the developers will take this feedback in mind. I initially was not going to write in a review, but after seeing others share similar sentiments, I think Dayone should reconsider their layout."
DC12!?,11347114739,2024-06-05T11:22:30-07:00,3,Day One was updated on my iphone this morning. Now the “Done” button doesn’t work so I can’t save any journals. My iPhone decided later in the day that the “Done” button would work
JQKY,11346614696,2024-06-05T08:41:51-07:00,1,"With each update the app is moving toward a 1990s DOS Screen. Keep some color to make it fun to use. It has always been difficult to edit the appearance of June one line. I would like to change a single word to boldface type. Just can’t do it easily. Overall I have enjoyed using the app, but I’m always looking for something better. Wish the original developers could come back. Oh well, that’s progress.

Update 6/5/24

I’ve used the app extensively for the past day.  It had my vote for the “Ugliest App in the App Store 2024”, if that is an anti-reward category.   The developers really love shades of gray and off-whites.  I’m convinced the developers are color blind, so probably I should apologize to them."

Unforgivnn,11345024270,2024-06-04T23:11:58-07:00,2,"Hello-

Been using Day One Premium for years as a very satisfied (paying) customer.

That said, I have to echo many others. The new UI is absolutely awful. The new “book” view requires extra clicks to get to stats that used to be at the top of the list view. It is a waste of space and is completely unnecessary.

There was no problem with the previous UI and this feels like change for the sake of change to try to give the perception of “staying fresh”. As a software developer myself, this is one of the worst things I see other developers do.

After years of paying for Day One, I genuinely find myself considering finding an alternative. Rather than responding with “we are here to help you through the changes”, PLEASE listen to your customers and bring back the previous UI. I don’t need your “help”. I have figured out how to use the new UI and have quickly concluded that I hate it."
RevanRem,11344614904,2024-06-04T20:01:04-07:00,1,"Latest update crashes the app when a journal is open and switches from portrait to landscape mode and then back to portrait.  Keyboard stays in landscape and minimizing and reopening the app doesn’t fix the issue and crashes.

I have to close the app entirely and reopen and keep the app in portrait only to prevent crashing during note taking.

Overall despite this love the app and have for many years. I assume the problem will eventually be resolved but will give a one star to draw attention to issue."
heykellies,11344489346,2024-06-04T19:08:07-07:00,3,"I love DayOne and have used it since 2013. What was wrong with the old layout? Now it’s cramped up to the top and much less informative at a glance. I liked being able to see the numbers, like where my streak is at, without having to tap to open another menu, and it was much more visually appealing when there was some room to breathe at the top. Would be nice to have the option to go back to the previous layout. There doesn’t seem to be any value add to this new change in looks."
jdn117,11344082213,2024-06-04T16:16:25-07:00,1,"Dev removed the selling feature of this app - making an offline, personal Instagram style photo journal - by putting a big menu bar over the photos. Then they respond to the complaint saying “we know adapting to change is hard”. Do not gaslight me. I have used this app for four years and I loved it. You need some customer service training. Do not trust these people to have any continuation of product. A journal app is a personal investment. They broke trust."
mrapplemacfreak,11343687657,2024-06-04T13:32:58-07:00,4,"I use this app for everything to keep myself organized. Recently though, I noticed a glitch where my journal entry lists are highlighted in the very unattractive yellow color at times, even though those were not highlighted by me, nor do they look highlighted when I open the individual entry. 

I also really miss the color bar at the top of each journal entry, so that you could see the journal in which you were writing. Now all individual entries look the same, regardless of which journal you are using so easy to mistake one journal for another. Can you please bring back the style, prior to the update, and can you please give us a prettier color to highlight with, such as a light yellow, green, pink, or blue, instead of mustard yellow?"

Kevin 72638393,11340246942,2024-06-03T15:16:38-07:00,1,"May 2024 UPDATE: They decided to totally change the UI. Yet again. It looks nothing like the award winning app of old, and they’re removing functionality (like you can’t see your sync status on the home screen anymore - arguably one of the most important functions of the app). The decline continues. I’m preparing to go to another journal service soon. I had high hopes but it’s clear Automatic is drastically changing things. This isn’t the Day One we all knew and loved. ANOTHER UPDATE: April 2024. Syncing is now a disaster. I’ve been down on multiple devices and despite half a dozen emails and tons of log files, support has no idea. What happened to you, Day One ?!?! Curse you, Automatic Inc, for the decline of what was once a shining example of a customer focused app with rock solid support. You are hastening people’s move off the platform. I WANT to use the app but every month there’s a new issue. Bugs are popping up all over. UPDATED AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE, 8/16/23: Nope, they're actually wrong. I'm a developer myself - you have a bug in your app. The exact commands referenced puts you in the same looped workflow of documentation and never opens the email client. And the revamped timeline still looks awful. I'm looking at alternative journal solutions - like Apple Journal or Bear Notes. Day One has gone backwards. UPDATED 8/1/23: They are making changes, and not for the better. Dropped from 3 stars to 2. They totally borked the time line view now - increasing the front size and adding useless data, so now you can only see like 3-4 entries at a time with lots of wasted space. Journal apps don't need constant UI changes. In fact - it's a problem. Journaling is a routine oriented task - and millions have adopted the Day One workflow. Changing it for no tangible benefit is crazy, and has me looking at Bear Notes and other alternatives. Who is driving these feature changes over there? It's getting worse... Oh - and despite being a premium user - you actually cannot contact support anymore! Their own documentation directs you to an area of the app that seems changed - it just redirects to old, outdated documentation instead of directing to an email message client. Yikes. If you are considering Day One as a newbie, consider something else. This app is not the clear winner it used to be. Fixes no one asked for, while user-favorite features (cough cough web app) are in perpetual Beta. OLD Review: The iOS app is great, but the application itself is severely lacking due to the recent, quiet, abandonment of their web browser app. They were working on it, and there was a highly anticipated beta - but it’s been shutdown and abandoned (they say temporarily, but it doesn’t look like it - they wouldn’t shut access down entirely if really temporary). There is currently no way to access any part of your journal on a windows desktop browser. So - the app is good, but it’s tedious in daily life as you can’t easily get items from your desktop into your journal."
@Magnuson,11339926387,2024-06-03T13:07:18-07:00,1,Day One has so many bugs and design deficiencies that there’s enough material for me to design a book. It is impossible to use this app without running into serious problems.

And then when I look at your social media and I see that so many people like me are angry about this so I complained to you and I get the response essentially “sorry no one likes it but you’re all screwed.”
I’ve lost all faith in these people and this app. And now I’ve lost six years of my life."

Doc Grun,11335233339,2024-06-02T07:42:50-07:00,1,"The new layout for the iPad app fundamentally changed how you work with the app and adds unnecessary extra clicks to see journals and past entries, like “On this day.”  Additionally, I used Apple Pencil and Scribble to write my entries so that I didn’t have to type and now the app no longer works well with that functionality. It’s led to a frustrating journaling experience that is supposed to be an enjoyable and calming part of my day. I reached out to support and got an AI chat bot response. I will likely be canceling my subscription to this app and looking for another app from a different developer. Sad and frustrated since this app was awesome before they decided to change it."
antevante08,11333758892,2024-06-01T22:37:40-07:00,1,Switching between portrait and landscape typing crashes the app. The new layout has less information and is buggy overall. It doesn’t save what you type anymore either. Hoping this is just temporary.

Design is a matter of taste. I don’t like it but perhaps other will love it. But some of the design decisions seems at least strange - who needs the book tab under which there is almost nothing actionable. 

But lack of functionality and plenty of bugs is unforgivable. Who needs the calendar when there is no opportunity to move fast to other date. Search is not working correctly.

I had previously given Day One a one star due to the fact the app was frozen. Several days the app icon was overlaid with the download progress widget and it would not open. It was also frozen on the App Store. The open option on the store did not work.  That problem was resolved by deleting the app through iPhone settings. That allowed the App Store to download a new copy of the app.

Since my encryption key was saved in the iCloud, the new download works great and all my journal entries are intact.

TiaSuzanne,11300347628,2024-05-23T20:26:39-07:00,5,"I’ve been using Day One for over five years. I have a premium subscription which I think is affordable at 24.99 a year. I have at least a dozen journals and use half of them regularly. I keep a diary, a work journal, and a health journal among others. I don’t use the text or email entry features, I find it easy enough to open the app and tap the journal I need. 

There are so many more ways I could be using this app, but I am satisfied with the basic functionality of journal access on the fly. I have had reminders set up for morning and evening, but I find that I just ignore them. I love this app most for jotting down in the moment thoughts and feelings, unloading after a hard day at work, drafting letters and memos, capturing career/work ideas, snapping pics of meaningful moments on hikes, and as a place to record  health information (I snap pics of after-visit notes from doctors).

However, I’d like to see them continue to improve it, even if they label it Advanced or Super Premium… and have to charge more.

I’d like to see a LOT more formatting and editing features.  I’d like to see advanced notation abilities.  

I’d like to see a Grammarly based system for auto grammar, spelling and punctuation.  

I’d like to see a suite of dictionaries that cover synonyms, Thesaurus, other languages… and an easy way to call up the one the user needs.

I’d like to see the Underline come back.  

I’d like to see an array of user chosen highlighters from a color wheel.

The book mark is great, and the ability to word search is very good, but I’d like the ability to narrow down the word/quote search in a more refined way.  I usually forget the word that I want to recall.  I also ask myself something like, “When did I write about such and such?” and don’t remember a single descriptive thing about the entry.

The bottom like is that I will stick with Day One even if it never changes, but advancing Day One is something that I would be very excited about.   Also, the Staff is way above and beyond any other of my 300 other apps."

I love the feedback you get for continuously journaling. I like that you can have your own password for day one and it not be your phone password. I like that extra layer of security. The widget is cool and so are the suggestions. One day I may pay for the subscription but for now the free version gets the job done. (You have to pay for luxury which I understand)."

I believe that there is a lot of areas that can be addressed when journaling and so far, Day One has nailed all areas. It is an amazing program and though it has only been 5 days. I do feel as though this will be something I stick with. I typically use journaling to get through issues or concerns, and sometimes huge emotional challenges. Once I write them out I tend to stop journaling, but with Day On, I feel that the templates for added discussions as well as the daily question or prompt, will help me stay a head of the emotional black hole I end up in."

Love that it has iPhone shortcuts to directly record audio and transcribe in one click. SMS into journal is also a good idea. 

Would love to see transcribe option or audio to text from Apple Watch rather than just have audio recording option from Apple Watch. Day one has great photo and video storage option but can’t be a replacement for Google photos yet. I would love to see advancements where I could ditch Google photos for Dayone. I know I am trying to have all in one but if this could have OCR from images and handwriting search then nothing can beat it. Hope to see at least some of the suggestions implemented."

Mah Jongg Mommy,11249543596,2024-05-09T11:16:15-07:00,4,"This app is fantastic! I use it for quite a few things. 
I use it for regular journal.
I have 17 chronic diseases and I use it as a daily symptom tracker. 
**Here’s where the app could improve: I have created a few symbols which I saved to my photo library. Example, one is a bright lightening bolt for bad neuropathy days. Unfortunately, because I have already used this photograph on the day it was created, DAY ONE won’t permit me to use it multiple times so I can see it as the main image on the calendar. 
I want to see these symbols I have created so when I visit with one of my physicians, I am able to pull up the calendar to see how often I was having symptoms for a particular disease. 
Perhaps Day One could create actual symbols / sticker / feelings face, to add to actual calendar… for example if I was glancing at the month, even though there is a photograph of my dog, I could add a symbol to acknowledge something medical related. 
A ""+"" symbol on each day of the calendar would allow a person to add a necessary symbol (pretty much almost any emoji that is currently available on the keyboard would suffice). 
Users need a way to put something visible on the view of the monthly calendar so they can refer back to a specific day and not have to search through every entry to find what they were looking at. 
One symbol I made is ""HEALTH UPDATE"" it’s purple and turquoise. It takes the place of a personal photograph. However, because I created it January 3, 2024… Day One says I already used that photograph and I am not able to override it and use it again and again anytime I choose. 
*App should permit people to freely use the same photo as often as they choose… it’s their choice!
Otherwise… love the app!"

Twice now, I’ve had issues where entries have not synced properly from my iPhone to my iPad. Only part of the entry transfers over. I get a message saying “there is a later version” but this so-called later version is actually the partial entry. The later part completely disappears, it’s not even visible in the cloud. So I have several paragraphs that no longer exist. I do not appreciate losing my writing, especially when I can’t get a message to the company about what is happening.

UPDATE: Developer, could you please explain to me when I try to access your forum, I am being directed to a site to create a “domain”? Why is that even necessary? The only way I can communicate with you is through this review."

Whatever you want to call it. We who bought your app from the early days. The ones who bought it SEPARATELY FOR ALL iOS iPad AND MACOS devices can now move along. Nothing to see here. Just call it whatever you want but no way is a subscription model worth anything when Apple has a perfectly great substitute NON SUBSCRIPTION ALTERNATIVE in the app store. You guys are all the same. Stop updating apps for those who were with you from the jump. Who overpaid from the jump because we believed in you. Wanted you to grow and succeed.

I was looking for an app that would help me document my journey into the crafting world - saving photos, learning techniques etc.  but I soon was using it for documenting nearly everything in my life.  From being able to have multiple journals, to tags, and the ability to access my journals on all the platforms I use (iOS, Mac, Windows) - this app hits every checkmark for what I wanted in a journal, and more!  

I recently had to contact support for help with an issue, and immediately got a response (AI assistant), and when my issue was more complicated (so I thought), got an immediate response from one of their ""Happiness Engineers"".  That made me smile twice: first on reading it, and second because the help I got really made me happy!  (As it turned out - it wasn't anything with DayOne app, it was user error, but the Support folks were amazing in helping me understand what happened!)

Some of the other features include being able to add or include other types of media to your entry.  Although I personally do not use this feature, it is cool to know its there.

If this app measures up to its ratings and reviews It is going to be just the app I’ve been looking for. I will update this writing after using it for a month or so.

I paid for the app years ago before they changed to the subscription model, got over thousands entries in it. Suddenly my photo upload limited to only 1 per entry today, and was required to subscribe for premium if I want the original features back. Not gonna use Day One anymore for this reason, if they can do it to the old users, they can do whatever they like to anyone to maximise their profits any time later."

I am really concerned because I have over 200 or more journal entries and I can’t access them or create new journal entries. I used to use the text feature to add a journal entry and it was so easy but now I can’t login. I don’t know if it’s because I got a new phone or what. But as I said, at the beginning, the help feature on this app is absolutely horrible. THEN THEY TRY TO PATHETICALLY answer / of COURSE I have an email with the login and there’s ZERO WAYS to actually get help. There’s no way to get to an actual person.

The total was $59.52 ($34.99 for Day One with a promotion, $19.99 for Me+, plus tax). I attempted to cancel and get a refund for ‘Me+’, but since it was purchased together with Day One, I couldn’t receive a partial refund. I got fully refunded $59.52 on January 18.

However, I recently discovered that I was rebilled by Apple on January 29, but I cannot access the Premium since it shows as cancelled. I can provide my bank transactions and the receipt from Apple.

Please help! I’ve tried reaching out to customer service, but there’s been no response. I haven’t been able to use the Premium features for the past three months. Can you please check?

48th Parallel,11109778640,2024-04-01T07:19:30-07:00,5,"I don’t know that this review is worth much as I have never used any other digital journal but for my many purposes, Day One is perfect.  I liked it so much I purchased another subscription for my spouse but she still prefers a paper journal with her fountain pen.  And here’s where the huge differences between the two forms really shows up.  When she wants to find the date when something happened, it’s a laborious search.  I just type the event or name or place into the search feature and I get all the hits, the most recent entry first.  With Day One I can add photos, video links, emails, texts, or even parts of daily newsletters I get as instantly as a 72 year old man can do anything instantly.  I have separate journals for books bought, borrowed, and read, for projects I’m working on, and for travelogues.  For my spouse to do any of those things is nye impossible in a paper journal just from a space standpoint.  And if I too want the feel and flow of ink on paper, which I often do, I do just that and take a photo to enter on my digital journal.
	But it’s when you’ve been at Day One for awhile that some of it’s marvelous features begin to show up.  The “On This Day” feature is a treat.  For instance, today it shows that I have four entries for today.  To click on that and discover anew what I was doing three, four, five years ago today is, in addition to being fun and informative, a daily jolt regarding the passage of time.
	Two other features I love about Day One is that it syncs my journal across all my devices.  I can jot down an entry on my phone when I’m waiting in line at the car wash or having lunch in a diner.  I can check on an entry from last year when I’m on the go.  The other thing I prize is the privacy.  My Day One is password protected which allows me to be a little more free with personal details than I otherwise would be.
	Does Day One have some warts.  I’ve yet to meet an app that doesn’t but, again, for my needs this things I would like different are so few that I haven’t even bothered mentioning them to management.  I hope I’ve made it clear why I think this app deserves five stars."
lmatt12,11104518769,2024-03-30T19:59:31-07:00,5,Love this journal and look at it everyday.  I’ve been writing in it for 12 years now. I go look at what I was doing this day for the last 12 years. I don’t even remember some of the thing I wrote and I’m so glad for each and every memory. Thanks Day One for a quality product.
Sheila Burns,11103173456,2024-03-30T10:59:41-07:00,5,"One of the features I love, having used Day One for several years, is that it lets me know I have previous entries from same date in years past and of  gives me access to read entries from same dates in years past. 
 Day One also has a search feature that easily helps me to find topics that I wrote about last week or last year."
Macorin,11099772681,2024-03-29T13:03:54-07:00,2,"I bought Day One for iOS and OSX but didn’t feel the need to purchase a subscription. I would have if it offered features I couldn’t live without, but it doesn’t, so why spend the money unnecessarily? I’ve rated this app two stars because the journal is good, even if buggy at times. I couldn’t go more than two stars because I don’t think it’s right that they reserve live support for subscriptions only. I paid money for your apps and should be able to get support when needed. I can see giving subscription members priority support and making others wait longer, but to not offer live support to those that have supported and purchased your products before subscriptions were even a thing is just wrong. If a subscription offered me something I needed, I’d buy it, but I don’t need to add more than ten photos or videos to my entries. And I certainly won’t pay just to get support. In fact, that alone is reason enough to never buy the subscription. You might as well call your subscription a support plan, not a subscription."

I first got so annoyed that I started to reverse my order of journal entries so that the first thing I could do when I opened Word was write my newest journal entry! It eventually got so messy and long though, so then I thought, “there’s GOT to be something else out there!!! This is the 21st century for Christ’s sake!!!” Then, I opened the App Store and found Day One, and my life was literally changed forever, and I could not be more thankful for this app!!! ?????? I’m currently using Day One’s free premium trial, and it’s so great that I wish so so badly I could make my own money bc if I did, I would TOTALLY pay for a subscription immediately!!!

I was so excited to use the new and improved version; however, it is constantly (and by constantly, I mean with each and every use) crashing. No matter what I try to do (write a new entry, look at historical entries etc) or where I try to do it (iPhone vs iPad), the app freezes, and the only way to fix the issue is to close the app and go back in. Further, even when I am typing on the new app, there is a big lag in the words. Please please please fix this. This app would be perfect if only it didn't freeze all the time!"

Yogiini Carolyn,11085342173,2024-03-25T14:29:26-07:00,5,"I keep about 12 sub journals concurrently with salient topics.  It has become a lifesaver for me as well as an easy way to check on a particular subject.

When I suffered with serious digestive issues, I started one titled Gastrointestinal.  Appointments with my gastroenterologist were very disappointing because he would say, “No coffee.”  Then when I read his notes concerning our office visits he would reiterate that the colonoscopies were unremarkable but I was described as labile.
     That really made me angry.  Of course I’m labile, if you were going through what I’m dealing with you would be labile, too!   I was actually contemplating how I could leave this plant without it looking like suicide.  It was that bad. 
     I thought, “OK, Buddy, you are about to get some journal entries.”  I copied about four horrendous days of entries and gave them to the receptionist for him to read before my next appointment.  They became part of my health record so they couldn’t be ignored.  
    Outcome:  he ordered an upper GI, lower GI and stool sample.  At last I was heard.  Result:  no pancreatic digestive enzymes and I needed supplementation.  I was normal at last after years of agony.
     If you have a chronic condition and are being gaslighted, I urge you to keep a journal on the symptoms and and how they are impacting your life.  Tell your story and be honest and graphic.  Dates and times and related events are important and helpful for diagnosis."

cpoetree,11081634725,2024-03-24T13:44:56-07:00,5,"Day One provides space and encouragement for more than a memoir, a diary or a daily journal.

With a provocative prompt for each day and the possibility to include images, it offers space for musing and personalizing life as we live it.

It is beautifully formatted, allowing search, dating and recall to happen easily.  Also, when one runs into a snag (and I have) help is readily available.  I have found it to be clear and effective.

If I could afford it, I would readily choose to update my Day One to premium.  Although I cannot, using Day One on a primary level is a delight this daily user would not miss.

Day One helps me grow!  Thank you to those who created it, maintain it and update it!  I'm beyond grateful."

With that, I purchased the premium, and since have experienced numerous quirks which have caused me to alter my opinion.

Far too frequently I have received “are you happy with your experience?” pop ups as I’m trying to utilize the app which appear in inconvenient locations (like over something I’m reading or trying to write)..and if that was annoying enough,..they have seldom worked, or went away, literally blocking my screen!!

Other times,..things I’ve clicked on direct to other places on the app I was not intending to see!

I would not be concerned about any of this had I not paid!

So unless they correct these bugs soon, I’ll be cancelling my subscription and would greatly warn anyone from paying for the premium package."

I tell people about it all the time because I have nothing but good things to say. There are so many features that I love about it! Just so incredibly well designed.

I’ve never loved something so much in my life. Writing has become part of my daily routine. The journal categories allow you to compartmentalize so many things and the fact that you can make notes on your phone to deep dive into later on the PC is just phenomenal. I can take create an entry while walking at the park and make quick notes of a podcast I’m listening to, then recall and complete the whole idea when I get home. If thoughts start creeping in while laying bed and I’m having difficulty falling asleep, again I can make a quick entry to dump the idea from my brain, and sleep comfortably knowing I can address the next morning on the pc. There’s just so much utility with this app. I love it. If I ever become a famous writer, this will be mentioned as one of my favorite and most valuable purchases of all time."

Here are the things I really like about Day One -

— can use across all my devices with ease
— I am able to copy, forward and even create PDFs of my entries when needed - this was a big let down with the apple journal app… I started using that until I realized that you cannot copy or export anything once it is in their app. 
— picture tagging - love that the app automatically goes to the pictures with the same date(s) as the journal entry.  Makes it so simple.
— hashtag capability - makes this easy to organize my journal in a way my mind works
—automatically imports instagram posts (now, we just need it to do the same for facebook - that’s where I posted a lot of my stuff before) 

Enhancements I would like to see:
—facebook post integration
—bible app integration would be AMAZING"

However last week I was scammed and lost access to my Apple ID. The scammers locked me out of it. I had to get a new id. I wrote to the support email explaining the situation and got back a template email with links to their FAQs- and said they only give individual support to those who pay. You call that good customer service? I don’t. I won’t be using their app again. I heard from the developer but I am still not satisfied. In fact, I am very angry. Any link you provide to offer help is a link to the help page. Option 1 is the Help guides which are links to articles and tutorials. Option 2 is the DayOne forum, but In order to write to the forum you must have an account on Wordpress-something I don’t care to have- even if the first year is free. The only other option on the page is for premium users, of which I was one but cannot use it because I lost the use of my AppleID. As I said above, I won’t be back.

robeeenz,11030960230,2024-03-10T16:19:37-07:00,2,I have been a Day one user since the early days when they were trying to get off of their feet. I became a plus user as a grandfather. Now the app is making me either log out and delete everything and re-login and upload everything or I have to delete the app and reinstall it for it to notice that I’m a plus user. I tried to write customer service but they told me I am not a premium user I am a free user so there’s not much help for me. I guess I will  have to download everything and just leave Day One. that’s the problem with putting your life online. If a company changes something then It could adversely affect you.

I was in a dark place in life and was told to journal my thoughts before bed each day but was too lazy actually write on paper ( True Statement ??)

This broke a habit I had fought hard to pick up. I had brainstorming going on in some of those 144 entries—story ideas I wanted to revisit and expand on. They’re long gone now, and I’m just now getting over the anger, frustration, and sadness of all my lost material.

That being said, I can’t rate this app less than three stars. It’s still a neat little app."

While I appreciate the ability for friends to comment on my journal entries, it would be immensely helpful if they could also co-edit them. Currently, they're only able to comment, leaving us to work on the journal separately rather than collaboratively. Adding the option for friends to edit entries would greatly enhance our ability to work on the journal together. Thank you for considering this feature addition!"

It has an option if you want notifications or not and doesn’t just automatically send them to you. I can unwind my day before I go to sleep and it’s the best way to do that! It also improves your typing and grammar but you don’t even work at it, you just get on the habit over time. Overall you should get this app because it’s a helpful app that gets me to sleep every night and brings myself up looking at the good parts of my day."

Switching to Diarium from here on out - it has just about everything Day One has, doesn’t require a subscription (only a one time fee for the same features Day One subscription-walls), plus it’s not run by people who gladly house transphobes and other bigots on their social media platforms."

I loved being able to journal whatever I want. However, I quickly realized it was lacking features such as the ability to back up entries outside of the app. I discovered Day One as an alternative. The app does every thing I need and more. I do think that there is some features that could be added on for quality of life. I hope the app keeps improving."

The thing that I like most about this journal is that I have been used to using a five-year journal where I could see every year previous. I couldn’t find an online one that did this. This journal does! It shows you a year in review. I haven’t made it yet, but I’m happy to know that it’ll show me what I’ve done in previous years on the same day. A great journal! So easy to use."
houstonbruce,10952701238,2024-02-18T06:20:18-07:00,5,"UPDATE: February 2024
I really enjoy Day One. They make it convenient to journal. I also have a text reminder that reminds me, daily, to write. It is so convenient to do this, and often, I copy and paste messages I have written others, into my journaling process. Why write things twice.

One feature I want to explore more of is family journaling, but I am not sure my family would want to do this. 

Templates make things easier if you have repetitive forms of journaling in mind. 

UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2023 I do not really have any complaints with this app. It does what it says, and I feel that my data and personal information is reasonably-secure. I like being able to text my entries. Helpful if I have already written something I want to document that I have written to family or friends via text message. That was a feature I really liked—the ability the app had to ask if I wanted to open the application after using iOS Share Sheet to post a journal entry. If it went away, please bring it back. It is super-helpful to have the option to click and just go directly into the app."

It gives me a chance to reflect on each day and reminds me of the good things and experiences in my life.  The ability to add photos and memories is fantastic.
As I said it’s been 80 days since I started journaling and look forward to years as this is a great way to diary and reflect on your life experiences."
McCarthyAero,10948782130,2024-02-17T05:49:27-07:00,3,"I like the format for the most part. For some reason - perhaps a bug - entry’s will not record. The process goes like this. Hit the “plus” to begin the entry, type, perhaps a few photos. Hit “done” - poof! Gone. The entry is not saved. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. Frustrating."
OnHD,10938132431,2024-02-14T07:11:49-07:00,1,"I’m a PLUS legacy user. I find their weather service is in accurate and I don’t want my historical journal entries to be incorrect. That seems incompatible with why one journals to begin with. I’ve asked Support if I can disable the weather service entirely. However they declined to answer my question because I’m not a premium user I paid money for the version of the app that I use, and as a paying customer I expect some level of support at least for simple questions. I’m not pleased that this developer has chosen to ignore needs of non-premium paid users. I found you could ask this question of their automated online chat bot, and you get an answer, it’s just an answer that is not true, and it directs you to take steps with features that don’t exist.
2/14/24 Update: I did receive a developer response in informing me that my Plus plan was discontinued nine years ago. I’m well aware of that. My point was, while the plan may have been discontinued, I still purchased the app and the developer has my money. It’s my feeling that there should be some “support” quid pro quo connected to that fact, otherwise the developer has simply stiffed a paid customer. Don’t get me wrong, I still love the app and will continue to use it, as it far surpasses anything it’s competitors offer. I just feel cheated on the Support issue, and I think others should be aware of that."

macbookpro15,10934348008,2024-02-13T06:17:26-07:00,2,So I’ve used day one for the last 2 years and I have had a premium membership with them. Unfortunately the app quality has gone down over time with the app having a lot of bugs. This I understand to some extent however their support is very bad too. The turn around time for answers is over a week I have had several tickets with them and the answering took forever and at the end of the day their support engineers are just not equipped to do proper support. I literally figured out two issues on my own when their support was unable to help me one was with ordering a book and the other one was with the payment failing. In both cases doing a clean install and losing all the books I prepared fixed the issue. I think if they want to be around for a longer period of time they need to step up their game and go back to how they used to be.

Can’t say enough good things about it, but I do have one issue I would like you to address and that is could you make the scrubber bar on the iPhone etc I noticed it’s white. Could you make it a color so it stands out more. I missed it for the longest time before I realized it was even there. Just saying. It’s great when you scrub and the date appears next to it that makes it supper easy to find a particular date. Thats really smart. Thanks for an exceptional app

Oh yea almost forgot…Is there anyway you could do the find function so it’s highlighted? Whenever you do a find for something you need to look through the whole entire entry to see where it’s at as it’s never highlighted in yellow etc like most apps do. Is that a possibility to change that? I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for your great work."
Geekgirl1971,10907585644,2024-02-06T00:20:19-07:00,3,I’m very disappointed and upset with this app. I recorded my first audio recording last night. Then I went through the written dictation and corrected the grammar issues and mistakes it made with what I said. A process that took me 20-30 mins to fix. I hit done and it appeared to save. A few moments later I realized my entire entry just vanished. I’ve looked everywhere on my account and found nothing. What is the point of using this app if it doesn’t store my recordings. And how do I get to the cloud part of the app that’s showing at the top of the page? I sent a message through the contact us area but no one has bothered to respond. I’m not going to pay for an app that wastes my time and efforts.

Every morning after I do my daily devotional I do my entry from what I did the day before. Having the pictures to look back on is priceless.

I stated that another good friend has kept a journal since he was a boy. She told me… “It’s never too late to start!”

I started this journal that day, as a way of logging information for my grandchildren when they are older.  

Over the last 900 plus days, I’ve expanded how I use it to log a record of health related items.  I keep adding other things too.  Any time I have something that I think could be noteworthy, I log it.  For example something that might be useful in documentation of a legal matter or whatever.  

Lastly I make sure to log every day.  In addition to keeping track of my weight and exercise I’ve done, I’ve set a goal to actually do something during the day that is noteworthy.   Another way to say that is to make sure I don’t have to disappoint myself by stating that I didn’t do anything today!"

big-man-gamer,10874475865,2024-01-28T09:39:30-07:00,5,"i really like this app because of its simplicity but i think it could be a great addition to have an exact word count option somewhere, you get an rounded to the thousands when you look at ordering a journal but i think there should be an option to add more stats or less stats, i’ve always liked being able to see how much of something i’ve done, this doesn’t really subtract from the overall expirience but it would be a nice addition."
Holy Ghost G33K,10873673664,2024-01-28T05:34:43-07:00,5,"The app is very user friendly, yet concise. I am especially enjoying the Windows beta. Apple ecosystem at home, but at work we are window based. So when I have downtime, it allows me to let my thoughts flow while I have the environment of tech at my fingertips. Please allow this app on multiple platforms…
Thank you for this app. It really has helped from a cathartic sense."

L Shax,10862657418,2024-01-25T07:11:04-07:00,5,"OK, I am not a big journal writer, but the Day One app has so many capabilities and is so easy to use that I just love it!

I keep a regular photo journal here where I put time stamped curated photos, and this can be done at the end of each day, or a month later when you have some free time or are home sick or whatever. I also use this to jot down some story about an event or day f I want.

On any given day, I will snap a few pictures of something that brings me joy to include in this journal. I don't need to worry if the photo is 'good' or if anyone else will like it. It is just for me!  When I go back through my phone camera roll, most days have something, and there are fond memories!

This is also great for journalling trips, etc. 

I also keep a private journal (both are private, but this one double-checks before showing any previews on my screen), and this is where I vent, complain, record frustrating experiences, etc. It is so much easier to move on from something if you have documented how it made you feel. This journal helps me move past this, but also allows me to go back and process as needed, and can be a helpful reference for therapy sessions. 

Oh, there is also a email option where I can type an entry into an email that will send directly into my journal. I use this for longer entries. 

I really like having a separate app for all of this to avoid feeling like it might be a Google or Apple product that I might feel stuck with later."
TimM8c,10859592779,2024-01-24T11:04:28-07:00,5,I have been using Day One since 2017.  I find it so useful in so many ways.  I use it for a day to day list  at the end of my day to remember daily events.  I use it for different workshops and classes I attend.  For poetry writing.  For a prayer journal.  I love the search feature.  I used to keep handwritten journals but then lost track of things I had written.  I do wish there was an easier way to transfer a document into a word document.  Other than that I highly recommend this journal.

I’ve lost interest in the public aspect and paper journals are almost more than I want to do on a daily basis. I found Day One through the Wonder Tools newsletter and decided to try it out. 

It’s packed with features. Even if you don’t know what to write, there are handy templates and prompts to help you develop a writing habit. For me, it’s therapeutic and helps me work out things in my life through thought and documentation. 

I really can’t recommend it enough."

However, I cannot understand how they expect people to type a 1-2 page journal every day on their phone. This doesn’t make sense at all. Yes, the app is nice with lots of features, but there has to be a PC version, or at least a web version that does’t look like an 8 grader designed and developed it. Especially when Day One is the most expensive journal “solution” out there. Honestly, I have no idea why people give this a 5 star, but I bet my life they are all Mac users. Deleted."

Staring at an empty page and feeling the need to write something profound. Or journal prompts I found didn’t really resonate or inspire me. I recently found Day One and I’m addicted! It’s only day 6 and I already have 17 entries. The prompts allow me to explore and be curious. Even though I’ve reused journal prompts on different days, it’s never boring. Each day brings new opportunities and obstacles and so the prompts feel brand new. I cannot tell you how much this app has helped with my mental health and overall happiness. This is literally the second review I’ve ever written but I had to because it was so important to me. Download it!! You won’t regret it."

I tried fixing it by turning off the iPhone and even deleted and reinstalled the app a couple of times but that didn't work, then. 

I next contacted the apps help line and got a message back that my problem would be passed on to their tech people.

Today I tried again to make a new entry on the iPhone app and it still froze so then I tried deleting the app and afterwards turning off my iPhone for five minutes.

When I reinstalled Day One app on my iPhone and waited till after it synced with icloud downloading all my past entries I again tried to make a new entry and this time it worked!

I  guess that the apps tech must have been working on it so my deleting the app and reinstalling it this time worked,  so if you have the same problem try it!

UsefulReviewsNow,10764437988,2023-12-30T15:00:30-07:00,4,"The journaling concept is amazing. It meets all my needs and is by far the best free app of its kind. Unfortunately, there are a lot of drawbacks if you don’t choose the premium plan, which is roughly $36/year. For instance, if you don’t want to splurge on premium, you can not add videos or multiple photos into one entry. It is to be noted that you can add one photo per entry without premium. Also, there is no cross-device sharing without premium. You can’t start on your phone and end on your Mac unless you pay the price.

Overall, these don’t detract from an otherwise enjoyable journaling experience, but without premium, the line is thin between Day One and the standard Apple Notes app."

DayOne is integrated across the iOS platform, so you can quickly send photos, articles, or inspiration from around the internet to your journal. The tagging and searching are top notch. You can even create separate journals for different projects or themes.

One of the best features is the location, weather, and activity logging that seamlessly integrate into new entries. When I’m out and about, I take a lot of pictures, but don’t always add them to DayOne the same day. When I create a new entry, I can add the photos and am immediately prompted to apply the photo date and location, so it keeps everything in order.

I love how the developer keeps making DayOne better. I know Apple has launched their own journalling app, but I’m committed to this wonderful app that has stood the test of time and is now a daily feature in my life."

I trusted this app to not crash and eat 2 hours of working on an entry, and that’s exactly what happened to me. I’m on an M1 iPad Pro. I am so displeased right now."

Day One is a little different than Evernote, but just as useful.  I have almost 50 journals on various topics and time periods.  I use the app to keep track of my business and my nonprofit.  I take notes for the books I’m writing.  I use Day One to remember important things.  My entries often use pictures, videos, and audio files.  The whole thing is searchable.  It is my brain, stored on a handy device in my pocket.  For 2024, I plan to use Day One even more, recording notes and thoughts from almost every aspect of my life.  It is effortless to use.  I hope it remains just the way it is, for many years into the future.  One improvement I wouldn’t mind would be if the voice to text was a little more accurate sometimes.  It gets about 90% of the words right, and I can usually make the corrections pretty quickly.  I wish every app I use was this dependable, versatile, and useful."

I love writing, but I have always struggled with sitting down to write and getting overwhelmed while staring at a blank page. This app has a dictation feature which allows me to speak freely while the app transcribes it in real time. You can then go back and edit later. This is incredibly useful to me in the mornings, when most of my ideas hit me, but I have very little time to write them down because I’m getting ready for work. This app allows you to record and leave it running so you can simply talk at your device when you have something that you want to write down. There are many incredibly useful features in here, but the transcription is the one that wins the day for me. I highly recommend giving this app a try if you are a writer at heart, but struggle either with time or feeling overwhelmed in figuring out where to start."

Its user experience is unmatched, providing a seamless and visually appealing interface. The GUI is simply beautiful, making the act of journaling a delightful experience. One standout feature is the effortless insertion of media from the current date, allowing me to easily enhance my memories. Additionally, Day One offers simple markdown support, enabling me to format my entries exactly how I want them. 
The inclusion of daily prompts adds a creative touch, sparking inspiration for my journaling journey. I particularly appreciate the ""On this day"" pop-ups that remind me of my thoughts and experiences from a year ago, giving me a chance to reflect and appreciate my own growth. Furthermore, Day One rewards users for creating streaks, encouraging consistency in journaling. Overall, Day One surpasses all other journaling apps with its unmatched user experience and  features."

Its developers never listened to users and called us “vocal minority” when we asked for something THEY did not like. Removed all the great features from the app, photo stream was great once, now it’s no different from regular photo app, limited many features under subscription. Broke the book printing (our family bought a plan and tried 5 times to print the book - never worked, support couldn’t help). So it brings us to the present day with an app crippled by its own creator. Well, classic human story with its roots in the ancient scriptures."

A password recovery email was sent, I followed the link, and it would open up a Chrome tab directly to my account.

Which means that someone would merely need to have my email and request an account recovery and have direct access to my day one account on Chrome.

As an extension, the password recovery would do as I have outlined above and to change my password I wouldn’t have to reenter the password that I forgot.

Lastly, when I go to speak with customer support or “contact customer support I don’t actually get to contact anybody. I am directed to the FAQs or their forum, which to post, and I need to sign in."

I tried the recent apple journal, but at this time, there’s no comparison. I suspect though, apple might iterate to the point where dayone might start need to worry, even the paid version of dayone.

Now they just made the previous app unusable and replaced it with this new one so that they could get more money. Original app you paid once and you were done. Now they try to make you pay a monthly fee for “premium” to get basically the same thing as what I already owned. They don’t even offer like a curtesy credit for the users who had paid for the previous app. They didn’t do any of this to benefit the consumer. They did it to get more money. Why would I pay for a monthly subscription to write like I can on the built in iPhone notes app?! Ridiculous

iOS notes
Notebooks by Afons Schmid

I’ve whittled it down to two : 
 iOS Notes and Day One.

I’ve been using iOS notes for 15 years. I have used Day One in the past. But wasn’t satisfied with it. Then they did a super upgrade to it and it appears as though it’s a strong contender for the best Notes app. I’ve compared iOS notes with Day One feature by feature, capability by capability. So far Day One is  in the lead. But it’s close. I’ll post again when I’ve decided."

Knowing that I’d inevitably randomly get signed out and get flustered and upset having to reset a password I wouldn’t remember, I chose to sign in with Apple. The app read my face and accepted it. Then…nothing. I could never get past that page even after the face scan recognized me every time. 

If just accessing the app doesn’t work correctly, how annoying is using it going to be? Deleting it right away. Disappointed, it looked fun and helpful."

Lalit Mishra,10651625209,2023-12-02T20:41:29-07:00,5,"Day One Journal App stands out as a premier digital journaling platform, providing a seamless and enriched experience for capturing life's moments. Its interface is elegantly simple, inviting users to document their thoughts and activities without the distraction of cluttered toolbars.

One of Day One's most compelling features is its versatility. Whether you're a minimalist who appreciates the one-click entry system and clean design or a detail-oriented person who enjoys cataloging entries with metadata like location, weather, and music, Day One caters to all. The app's use of templates and prompts ingeniously lowers the barrier to journaling, making it accessible even when inspiration is scarce.

For those who like to journal on-the-go, Day One's multimedia capabilities allow for a rich recording of experiences, enabling users to add photos, videos, and even audio to their entries. The app also respects the private nature of journaling, offering robust security features to protect personal musings.

Customizable reminders are another innovative aspect, helping users build a consistent journaling habit by setting multiple prompts throughout the day, tailored to their schedule.

In essence, Day One excels not just as a digital journal but as a companion for life's journey, providing a versatile, secure, and user-friendly space to document personal growth, reflect on experiences, and store memories."

Making a habit of using Day One has saved me time, lowered my anxiety, and saved me money. 
It’s worth the subscription. Get it. 

The longer version that ADHDers in particular will see themselves in and understand:

Losing time finding things, buying things you think will fix you but you never use, buying another of the thing you can’t find or forgot you already have, is the “ADHD Tax.” I’ve paid. 
(I personally consider losing writing, ideas, and pictures part of the ADHD tax.)  

Day One  is the first app (or physical book) I’ve ever used regularly. I did have to build the habit, but it wasn’t hard because Day One is effortless. 

I have many lovely journals. a couple bujos, planners, and the guilt from not using them. 
I used to have a lot of stuff “somewhere” and had to go on a safari every time I needed any of it. 

I use Day One for journaling, saving ideas for projects, corralling spicy social media drafts and angry emails safely away from that “send” button, cataloging stuff in bins, boxes, and baskets, venting, pet pictures, and checklisting.  
It’s a boss feeling when you think, “Where is the (insert thing  here)?” and I can look it up, see it’s in Bin 3, grab it, and get back to what I was doing. 
Day One has tagging so it’s even easier to find that #blue faux fur or tell yourself #Go Me. 

My one and only beef  is that Day One is a subscription instead of a purchase. I’d love a version I could buy and set to back up to Dropbox or my personal cloud storage. 
On the other hand, this year’s cost of using Day One is definitely less than an unused planner and replacing a jacket."

I'd be much more consistent in journaling if I was just able to access it through the internet with a desktop.

Strickland Painted Farm,10606309132,2023-11-20T10:19:00-07:00,5,I have always wanted to have a journal but never took the time to sit and write one. This app is amazing for me to jot down thoughts throughout the day and love the little reminders they send me.
Buckc12,10605608113,2023-11-20T06:17:43-07:00,5,"I have been using Day One for about 9years and absolutely love it. Would not even look at another journaling ap. I have written a book titled The Most Important Hour detailing the “why” and “how”of journaling featuring Day One. I journaled for 30 years before I found Day One, Day One raised and keeps raising the bar of the practice that most powerfully changed and enhanced my life."

Mainly, I love how it’s private. If you live around lots of people and always feel like when you write it’s not safe, this app is for you. Just make sure no one knows your password to your device. If anyone has any other features they would like to tell me that would be great! Thanks!

EDIT: sorry I don’t think you can reply to reviews my mistake. ??"

dj anthony lovell,10593827508,2023-11-16T22:04:57-07:00,5,I was waiting for Apple’s journal app. But I wanted to get things moving so with a little research I got day one. I’m really happy with the app. It does way more than what I need. But I’m still curious to see what Apple has to offer in this space.
Reesa225,10593014572,2023-11-16T15:33:43-07:00,5,"Loving this app and the fact that you can attach pictures to your entries is awesome. I love how it shows a month view of all the days you’ve journaled. When trying to create a habit of journaling, this is a great way to see if your on track. I also really like the prompts. I love pen and paper, but it’s not always easy to pull out a notebook and track down a pen, but a cell phone, thats usually close by. This app has really changed my journaling habits for the better."
MissLadylike,10590586523,2023-11-15T23:10:36-07:00,3,"I like the app because it’s been helpful in leading me back to journaling. But I don’t understand why there’s a $34.99 per year fee to use it and access  features like uploading multiple photos or media. I would be willing to pay a one time cost to own it, but paying $34.99 a year can get expensive depending on how long  you use it. You can get a similar experience using the Notes app on iPhone for free."
LNW LLC,10590226494,2023-11-15T20:07:53-07:00,5,I was a fan of journaling on paper for years and just wanted to experiment with something different. 2 years later and this has elevated the way in which I'm able to record the events and moments of my life. It even allowed me to complete some projects collecting audio messages from family members to keep in memory of them forever. Love this app
Bryan Caban,10586796256,2023-11-14T19:56:55-07:00,5,I love this app and I find it useful. Also love that it needs a password to be opened so that your entries remain private.
Cyndie_Kay,10586648111,2023-11-14T18:49:37-07:00,2,"I’ve been using this for years, and it was backing up to iCloud …. But a couple weeks ago I noticed a button inviting me to turn on  automatic sync. Well. BEWARE. When I did that, my journal of many years, all the entries and the journal itself, GONE. 
I have read the blogs and sleuthed to find an old backup in Time Machine, and that got me everything except this year and I just lost my father and had journaled that journey. Gone. I’ve tried contacting 3 times now and no one answers their email. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this company."
LeilaW77,10585741551,2023-11-14T12:02:04-07:00,1,Wanted to use but can’t even import old journal files so I can continue.  Error 3 code whether I do a json file or try to do a csv zipped file. Very disappointed
Honest Reviewer??,10583503164,2023-11-13T20:21:31-07:00,5,"I wish I didn’t have to go back and forth between my email and the app everyday to get the ‘Gratitude Challenge’ prompts. I love this app though, it helps me keep track of what times I have dips in my medicine, what time of the months I get sad, helps me organize my ADHD thoughts, and keeps my privacy.  I love how I can make unlimited  entries and each one has a time stamp."
LuvAmore,10581835264,2023-11-13T08:18:21-07:00,1,"There are a lot of bells and whistles that encourages journaling, which I love, but Some users love the idea of digital journal with the old-school handwriting option. For years, I’ve tried, but the single page at a time is not a great setup, and half-baked support with scribble is not good at all. I prefer writing and find myself doing so in a different app and then screenshots into DayOne. It's not a great workflow.  All advertised input options should be tested and meet a minimum baseline.

jdorris1906,10579426152,2023-11-12T14:55:38-07:00,5,"I’m not much of a writer. Given the fact I have a learning disability. Which means grammar is not my best friend. Let alone spelling. However, with the voice dictation feature I’m able to express my thoughts in words. Talk about my day or an event that I want to detail what’s happening. This app help me do that. I will encourage anyone with a learning disability or a person that may not physically be able to type to use the app. I encourage teachers to have just students use this app, if they do daily journals as part of their lesson. I’m excited to see what I can do with this."
Cgazave,10578187921,2023-11-12T07:24:00-07:00,5,I have used this app for many years now.  It has never left my Home Screen.  Such a wonderful (and secure) way to record the events of your life.

It helps me see that as much as there is to do, we have done a lot in the last five years. That is motivating. I really want to pay the developer for this wonderful app and perhaps get more premium features. But the $35/year price point/model is just not who I am. I prefer to pay once, while I have the money. I like expensive tools, and I love using 30 year old tools because the value. I don’t like subscriptions because my attention comes and goes and I don’t like committing my future earnings just to read my diary. Other apps do offer single fee OR subscription models, and I purchased them."
Mfslickly,10577437372,2023-11-12T03:13:16-07:00,5,The prompts have been incredibly useful and reflective.

One other bonus feature for me, if I happen to get busy and forget to send a photo with a comment, it will ask if I want to backdate it to the photo date. So far the only drawback is the look is a bit rudimentary and hard to really view on phone, no options. But this is my go to for documenting my day."
JohnBabcock,10574102073,2023-11-11T05:29:13-07:00,5,"I use this app regularly, almost daily.  It’s great.  It’s clean.  It’s secure.  I find journaling to be a great habit and Day One makes it easy to keep that habit."
Next47,10573710272,2023-11-11T03:16:28-07:00,5,Day One allows me to easily capture my thoughts/experiences/moments of my day.  One can easily document as much or little of your day/life seamlessly with this platform.  100% endnote it.  Even my 70+ mother-in-law has picked it up.  The best part - it is FUN!!!  Looking back at a day & reliving moments…it is priceless.

I will get premium someday to be able to open on my phone as well as my tablet and computer but for now, I just needed a journal.  It is hard to hold the habit when handwriting takes SOOO LONG.  This makes it so simple to vent and clear my head and get my thoughts organized on ¨paper¨ in no time and I am truly grateful for this app.

The prompts are genuine as well and they blend well with normal journal entries.  I truly love this."

sterlingts,10550151365,2023-11-04T11:52:11-07:00,5,"This app is EVERYTHING I need in a journaling app, and so much more! I’ve always been a pen to paper kind of journalist. One day I was sitting by a small river, with 3 different notebooks. As I was writing, I slipped a little bit on a rock, and almost dropped my notebook. I thought to my self, if I were to drop this notebook in the water, I’d lose everything in here. That made me think, maybe it’s time to go digital. At least it would all be backed up. I’ll fast forward a bit~ I tried several different apps, and I landed here. This app allows me to have everything in one place, it allows me to add pictures, songs, and really anything! It plays seamlessly between my computer, and phone (I pad if I wanted) and the convenience is incredible. It tracks where I made the entry, and the time (I’ve always had an interesting fascination with starting my entries with the date and exact time I’m journaling because I feel it captures the moment in it’s entirety. I’m writing this review at 11:37AM). It even captures the weather, which I suppose isn’t important (to me) but a fun detail. Ok, I’m trailing here~ this app is amazing, and I suggest you find out the features for yourself! I’m a daily journalist and this app lets me categorize everything exactly as I need it. I can search, and reference things as needed. I couldn’t possibly be more happy with an app! Everything is backed up, twice, and you can get your journals printed if you want them on the shelf! I haven’t used this feature yet, but I know the time will come. I do miss the tactile feel of writing on paper, but for what this app offers, the pros heavily outweigh the cons!!!!! At times when paper is what’s available,  I find my self taking a picture of the entry and logging it into the app. HERE’S YOUR SIGN, MAKE THE SWITCH. I can, nearly, guarantee you won’t regret it! I like that i have the option to password lock the app, because this is for me, and only me. I could go on, and on, but I’ll end this here. THIS IS THE ONLY APP I HAVE THAT I CAN SAY HAS TRULY CHANGED MY LIFE. For how much I journal, and what this app offers, I will gladly pay the subscription price :) JUST DO IT!"
smithjasonrichard,10548805364,2023-11-04T04:44:11-07:00,5,I’ve tried a bunch of different journal apps. I’ve tried different methods of journaling by hand. This app is better all around than everything.

Of course I downloaded it and now 5 days later I just decided I’m writing my OWN BOOK!! “10 More Years” I hope everyone enjoys this app as much as I do!!!
HAPowell,10542112317,2023-11-02T07:21:02-07:00,5,When someone tells me some nugget of info I want to remember I put it here.   I have a running list of books I want to read or shows/movies to watch.   I like that I can see entries by month or year and has a good search function so things are easy to find and add to. I don’t use it as a diary but I really love having it handy.
Jk2two,10541975627,2023-11-02T06:38:38-07:00,5,Use it everyday. That ‘Today’ feature is fantastic- exactly what you would want from a journal app.

Yet I wanted access to all my journaling! Them a fellow nomad introduced me to Day One. I have been using it ever since! When I am back with my old stack of journals I can scan in past entries and add them to my archive! I also love the photos options. This has allowed me to save special photos for later review and reduce my posting on social media where I used to put pictures I wanted so keep with special notes.

I love writing journal entries with it.
I think the free version of Day One should let user sync their journal entries across all of their devices.
Instead of including it in the premium version.
All in all, I recommend this app because it is fully accessible with the voiceover screenreader.
Giving Day One five stars."

There is a premium version available, but it is 34.99 per year. I don’t really need the premium features, but it would be nice to have. Overall this is an app that I use multiple times per day.

kalistowe,10482808068,2023-10-16T15:20:39-07:00,5,"I just paid the small fee for yearly subscription - gratefully. Day One is the place where everything comes together - all links (music, video, pdf, photos) bookmarks, accounting, reading, recipes, journaling. Give it a spin and find a central repository with security options for everything - an uncluttered running diary of life so you can get back to living it. Free up brain space for creative, enjoyable endeavors rather than searching for stored info across too many platforms. The tagging and multiple journal capabilities are the key to your freedom.

Update: a great app to store Freeform boards as pdfs.  

Syncing is seamless across the Apple ecosystem and love making audio notes and journals which can be AI transcribed."

Basic level no longer allows addition of a photo. With basic you can add a photo to an entry which has worked for me for as long as I have used the app (almost 8 years). The latest version of the app asks you to sign up for premium when you try to add the photo. Help pages are useless as you have to sign up for a Wordpress domain to use the forums. And then you can’t log in that way either. No way to contact support other than a chatbot which asks you, again, to sign up for premium. I really like this app but this is a step backwards."

kasia4484,10458147038,2023-10-09T23:24:27-07:00,4,"Improvement in Handwriting Experience

Rating: ????? (4/5)

I've been using the Day One app for some time now, and I must say, I'm a huge fan. It's an excellent tool for digital journaling, offering a plethora of features that make it stand out. The seamless integration with various media types, robust tagging system, and intuitive interface are all top-notch.

However, there's one area where I find room for improvement—the Apple Pencil experience. As someone who enjoys a more handwritten journaling approach, I was hoping for a smoother and more immersive experience. Currently, the app allows for drawing and basic writing, but it doesn't quite capture the essence of a true handwritten journaling experience.

I believe that a substantial update in this aspect would be a game-changer. If the app could enhance the handwriting capabilities to provide a more natural and fluid writing experience, it would undoubtedly elevate the Day One app to a whole new level.

While I started with the one-month free trial, I have reservations about extending it and purchasing the upgrade, primarily due to this reason. However, I'd be more than willing to become a loyal, long-term client if this particular feature is addressed in future updates.

In summary, the Day One app is fantastic, but there's a potential for perfection in the handwriting department. With some tweaks and updates, this app could easily become a five-star favorite for many, including myself.

funindasun998,10451898641,2023-10-08T04:38:01-07:00,5,I have been using it now for several years.  I enjoy being able to have several different journals for variety of areas of my life.
DrFunk,10448471716,2023-10-07T05:29:34-07:00,5,"I saw a video where a photographer was taking two seconds out of each day for a whole year and put it together in a few minutes of a movie. The images went flashing by in high speed, but your minds eye could capture the moment, and it was a memory brought forward. Fascinating how a short  movie was able to remind you of the whole year. I was all excited and thought I needed to do this however, that’s a lot of editing! So I found this app and decided that using the dictation system on the iPhone, and this app, I would start to record, the salient features of each day. I felt like life is going by too fast so I needed to record it. That was in 2019. Boy was I right because since then we’ve had multiple years of Covid, death in the family, issues at work and a national awards that my daughter got, all recorded in it in this app. After losing my wife, I’m so glad I have images and jokes and things to remember her by. I started recording 4 years before her death and now wish I had done this at the beginning. The app works flawlessly and I will continue to do so. I record a little something and some photo of each day. The stuff I want to remember and even the stuff I want to forget because I don’t wanna do that again! I finally printed out five books by now, so I have them on paper on my shelf. Time is your most valuable asset and we don’t record the events very well, thinking that will remember it all. Looking back at the books I can tell you those books are priceless. Thank you Day One."

I am not much of a journalist nor have I ever been, so I didn’t anticipate me keeping the app for a long period of time.

Also, I have two phones and they sync instantly and with full accuracy. That means it doesn’t matter what phone I have with me, or is nearest to me, I’m always up to date. 5 stars."

This deliberate chronicle, albeit digital, has its own set of new nightmares (e.g. losing brilliant drafts never to be recovered in this lifetime; 99 CENT pay wall hitting at that critical juncture where poverty and verisimilitude collide to disrupt the latest masterpiece with a Mephisto phenomenon option: or else!)

 I like the interface, platform, obvious intention & execution of this app. The ""interface"" to me means how I interact with the digital input of my thoughts and artist way type Journaling that I've been doing doe twenty odd years - so I want to pick up where I left off not have to adjust my creative process to some fraudulent fad, but rather seamlessly fold the ""platform"" which in this case is iphone app into my creative process. Which to some might be ""crazy"" or chaotic because I am highly creative. I don't want an application limiting the expression I have been honing over my 58 years on the planet. I appreciate the fluid format and ability to play with media within a post, love the fonts and am generally a huge fan. I went from premium at first to standard due to massive cuts in cash flow so all paid apps had to go until I could justify their value. I forsee at some point paying premium to complete an archive or print a thematic book. As a lifelong writer and photographer, a writer, Director and producer by trade and a storytelling maven by fate, I love this app and encourage writers or artist way type journal afficionadoes (those who use photorealism to convey their thoughts and emotions or visual poetry) out there to give it a try. It's pretty integrated so you can track your life archive across multiple tools and resources you already find useful in your digital dominion. I welcome the developers to set up.a forum for their loyal users to give more meaningful feedback. I'm genx and prefer contributing to projects that can best utilize my time investment. Cheers!

The best parts: it reminds me of journal entries I made on this date years ago; the export to PDF function; the ability to get a printed book of my entries (great quality, I use it often).

I rarely write reviews or I use apps for so long. I’ve used Day One for the past several years, and enjoyed it immensely. It’s the perfect tool for keeping a record of my life journey."

Yesterday I tried posting multiple photos to one entry and I could not. This is hugely frustrating as much of my entries used to be photos. Now we can only upload one photo a day?

I write on my iPad quite a bit and love to use slide-over and split-screen views to jot down thoughts in my journal while I am reading my Kindle book in the background. Hard to believe that Day One still craps out once you hit one full page of content within the app. Once you finish writing a full-page in slide-over or split-screen view, you can no longer see what you are writing because the app stops scrolling with your writing. You are writing “blind” so to speak. It is really hard to believe that this problem still persists after all these years and has frustrated me on more than one occasion.

PandaEyes87,11352473899,2024-06-06T22:10:03-07:00,4,"I know some users aren’t happy about DayOne’s new user update and how the UI looks very different now. It’s understandable that not everyone may like it. Personally, I liked the older UI much better, but am willing to give this new layout a fair try. 

Things might be a bit buggy and wonky while we all try to adapt to this new layout, but I’m sure those other things will be taken care of in time.

 I’ve been searching around for another journal app to use and nothing still comes close to DayOne. In my opinion, this is still the best journaling app out there and as long as they don’t continue to change things that make the app less user friendly and away from the original intentions of the app, I’m still willing to stick with them. 

Even when they do big updates like these that kind of has everyone mad about the change. As long as I try to get used to the change, then I think I will feel better about it later on."
venusamaris,11352062949,2024-06-06T19:04:40-07:00,3,"Updated to add: I do not love this new version. I have been using this app for years now. I always like the touches of color on the screen. Now they have stripped away nearly all the color. Why? It is so sterile and boring, and I honestly do not see the reason for the change. Were people complaining that it was too colorful. I kind of doubt that. Change for the sake of change is always a bad idea. Nothing about this latest update has improved my experience in using it. Learn to leave a good thing alone instead of messing it up in pursuit of a “fresh new look”.

Updated to add: I love the new location function in the latest update, it was just what I was hoping for. The developers are obviously trying hard to be responsive to users. They did not ""abandon iCloud"" here or charge money for an update. This is a NEW VERSION of Day One, and if you want to use it you will have to pay all of $5 - $10 (!), and learn to live with their excellent sync service. If you love the classic Day One, keep using it. It is not going away, or being abandoned. If you want iCloud sync, stick with the Classic version, do not expect this version to meet that need. The developers have done everything possible to communicate the fact that iCloud and Dropbox would not be available in v2, and why. It makes sense to me, and if I really want to keep using iCloud sync I can stick with Day One Classic. I recommend going to the developer website and reading their blog post from a week or so ago, which outlines why the changes and what they see as the benefit of using Day One Sync instead of iCloud. I have used Day One for a few years now, and I have always loved it. Journaling is very important in my life, I have done it since I was a kid and I have boxes of paper journals archived away. The original Day One was my go-to journal from the first day I downloaded it. I was a bit worried about the impending upgrade, I tip my hat to the developers of Day One for doing it right."

I’m typing some pretty emotional stuff and for whatever reason, I guess a slight movement of my phone, the app tries to go in landscape mode and just shows a completely jacked up display (unusable or distinguishable screen the app is displaying since it glitched out trying to switch the orientation). Nothing makes it go back to normal so I close the app completely and open it back up. And just like that the last few minutes of writing are gone. That might not seem like a big deal but when you’re just pouring into something, it’s coming from the heart, you’re not thinking about remembering what you just typed. Why would you even make the app to do that? How is that even possible? Does your app just “save” every couple minutes? Even something as simple as the Notes app that comes with the phone has never done that - once you type it it’s there regardless of when or how quick you close the app. So right there I just didn’t like the experience and am going to look for another app. Completely throws off the experience and now you can’t even trust the app to do the most basic of things - save what you wrote."

I really love the app, however the new UI change is confusing and generally bad — I really enjoyed the old tab where you could see the daily streaks plus the color coded bars helped me know which journal I was in. Also, I have to click in twice to see the “on this day tab” when I’d much prefer it to be fixed above my entries. 

Like many other reviewers mentioned, the book tab seems slightly redundant. I hope the developers will take this feedback in mind. I initially was not going to write in a review, but after seeing others share similar sentiments, I think Dayone should reconsider their layout."

Overall I have enjoyed using the app, but I’m always looking for something better. Wish the original developers could come back. Oh well, that’s progress.

Update 6/5/24

I’ve used the app extensively for the past day.  It had my vote for the “Ugliest App in the App Store 2024”, if that is an anti-reward category.   The developers really love shades of gray and off-whites.  I’m convinced the developers are color blind, so probably I should apologize to them."

Unforgivnn,11345024270,2024-06-04T23:11:58-07:00,2,"Hello-

Been using Day One Premium for years as a very satisfied (paying) customer.

That said, I have to echo many others. The new UI is absolutely awful. The new “book” view requires extra clicks to get to stats that used to be at the top of the list view. It is a waste of space and is completely unnecessary.

There was no problem with the previous UI and this feels like change for the sake of change to try to give the perception of “staying fresh”. As a software developer myself, this is one of the worst things I see other developers do.

After years of paying for Day One, I genuinely find myself considering finding an alternative. Rather than responding with “we are here to help you through the changes”, PLEASE listen to your customers and bring back the previous UI. I don’t need your “help”. I have figured out how to use the new UI and have quickly concluded that I hate it."

Now all individual entries look the same, regardless of which journal you are using so easy to mistake one journal for another.

Kevin 72638393,11340246942,2024-06-03T15:16:38-07:00,1,"May 2024 UPDATE: They decided to totally change the UI. Yet again. It looks nothing like the award winning app of old, and they’re removing functionality (like you can’t see your sync status on the home screen anymore - arguably one of the most important functions of the app). The decline continues. I’m preparing to go to another journal service soon. I had high hopes but it’s clear Automatic is drastically changing things. This isn’t the Day One we all knew and loved. ANOTHER UPDATE: April 2024. Syncing is now a disaster. I’ve been down on multiple devices and despite half a dozen emails and tons of log files, support has no idea. What happened to you, Day One ?!?! Curse you, Automatic Inc, for the decline of what was once a shining example of a customer focused app with rock solid support. You are hastening people’s move off the platform. I WANT to use the app but every month there’s a new issue. Bugs are popping up all over. UPDATED AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE, 8/16/23: Nope, they're actually wrong. I'm a developer myself - you have a bug in your app. The exact commands referenced puts you in the same looped workflow of documentation and never opens the email client. And the revamped timeline still looks awful. I'm looking at alternative journal solutions - like Apple Journal or Bear Notes. Day One has gone backwards. UPDATED 8/1/23: They are making changes, and not for the better. Dropped from 3 stars to 2. They totally borked the time line view now - increasing the front size and adding useless data, so now you can only see like 3-4 entries at a time with lots of wasted space. Journal apps don't need constant UI changes. In fact - it's a problem. Journaling is a routine oriented task - and millions have adopted the Day One workflow. Changing it for no tangible benefit is crazy, and has me looking at Bear Notes and other alternatives. Who is driving these feature changes over there? It's getting worse... Oh - and despite being a premium user - you actually cannot contact support anymore! Their own documentation directs you to an area of the app that seems changed - it just redirects to old, outdated documentation instead of directing to an email message client. Yikes. If you are considering Day One as a newbie, consider something else. This app is not the clear winner it used to be. Fixes no one asked for, while user-favorite features (cough cough web app) are in perpetual Beta. OLD Review: The iOS app is great, but the application itself is severely lacking due to the recent, quiet, abandonment of their web browser app. They were working on it, and there was a highly anticipated beta - but it’s been shutdown and abandoned (they say temporarily, but it doesn’t look like it - they wouldn’t shut access down entirely if really temporary). There is currently no way to access any part of your journal on a windows desktop browser. So - the app is good, but it’s tedious in daily life as you can’t easily get items from your desktop into your journal."

I believe that there is a lot of areas that can be addressed when journaling and so far, Day One has nailed all areas. It is an amazing program and though it has only been 5 days. I do feel as though this will be something I stick with. I typically use journaling to get through issues or concerns, and sometimes huge emotional challenges. Once I write them out I tend to stop journaling, but with Day On, I feel that the templates for added discussions as well as the daily question or prompt, will help me stay a head of the emotional black hole I end up in."

Love that it has iPhone shortcuts to directly record audio and transcribe in one click. SMS into journal is also a good idea. 

Would love to see transcribe option or audio to text from Apple Watch rather than just have audio recording option from Apple Watch. Day one has great photo and video storage option but can’t be a replacement for Google photos yet. I would love to see advancements where I could ditch Google photos for Dayone. I know I am trying to have all in one but if this could have OCR from images and handwriting search then nothing can beat it. Hope to see at least some of the suggestions implemented."

Mah Jongg Mommy,11249543596,2024-05-09T11:16:15-07:00,4,"This app is fantastic! I use it for quite a few things. 
I use it for regular journal.
I have 17 chronic diseases and I use it as a daily symptom tracker. 
**Here’s where the app could improve: I have created a few symbols which I saved to my photo library. Example, one is a bright lightening bolt for bad neuropathy days. Unfortunately, because I have already used this photograph on the day it was created, DAY ONE won’t permit me to use it multiple times so I can see it as the main image on the calendar. 
I want to see these symbols I have created so when I visit with one of my physicians, I am able to pull up the calendar to see how often I was having symptoms for a particular disease. 
Perhaps Day One could create actual symbols / sticker / feelings face, to add to actual calendar… for example if I was glancing at the month, even though there is a photograph of my dog, I could add a symbol to acknowledge something medical related. 
A ""+"" symbol on each day of the calendar would allow a person to add a necessary symbol (pretty much almost any emoji that is currently available on the keyboard would suffice). 
Users need a way to put something visible on the view of the monthly calendar so they can refer back to a specific day and not have to search through every entry to find what they were looking at. 
One symbol I made is ""HEALTH UPDATE"" it’s purple and turquoise. It takes the place of a personal photograph. However, because I created it January 3, 2024… Day One says I already used that photograph and I am not able to override it and use it again and again anytime I choose. 
*App should permit people to freely use the same photo as often as they choose… it’s their choice!
Otherwise… love the app!"

I have tried to send feedback but I am directed to a forum where I apparently have to have a “domain” and pay a fee in order to ask a question! Twice now, I’ve had issues where entries have not synced properly from my iPhone to my iPad. Only part of the entry transfers over. I get a message saying “there is a later version” but this so-called later version is actually the partial entry. The later part completely disappears, it’s not even visible in the cloud. So I have several paragraphs that no longer exist. I do not appreciate losing my writing, especially when I can’t get a message to the company about what is happening.

UPDATE: Developer, could you please explain to me when I try to access your forum, I am being directed to a site to create a “domain”? Why is that even necessary? The only way I can communicate with you is through this review."

Whatever you want to call it. We who bought your app from the early days. The ones who bought it SEPARATELY FOR ALL iOS iPad AND MACOS devices can now move along. Nothing to see here. Just call it whatever you want but no way is a subscription model worth anything when Apple has a perfectly great substitute NON SUBSCRIPTION ALTERNATIVE in the app store. You guys are all the same. Stop updating apps for those who were with you from the jump. Who overpaid from the jump because we believed in you. Wanted you to grow and succeed. Now its all cherry eyed happiness oh sorry no more updates we don’t need or want your support anymore. Just like Notability and all the rest. Good riddance.

I was looking for an app that would help me document my journey into the crafting world - saving photos, learning techniques etc.  but I soon was using it for documenting nearly everything in my life.  From being able to have multiple journals, to tags, and the ability to access my journals on all the platforms I use (iOS, Mac, Windows) - this app hits every checkmark for what I wanted in a journal, and more!  

I recently had to contact support for help with an issue, and immediately got a response (AI assistant), and when my issue was more complicated (so I thought), got an immediate response from one of their ""Happiness Engineers"".  That made me smile twice: first on reading it, and second because the help I got really made me happy!  (As it turned out - it wasn't anything with DayOne app, it was user error, but the Support folks were amazing in helping me understand what happened!)

From the way I plan my day. To the way I have learned to navigate my thoughts with more precision. It’s a must have. From the customization by colors of journals. To the sharing across devices. DayOne has effortlessly reawakened my love for writing. It’s a 5 star app. From a free user. I would love to see what a paid subscription could bring. I test the Beta and it’s def worth the money.

If you are more seasoned and/or you know how and what you want to write about each day, you can easily build a custom template and begin with the same template each day.  
I love being able to add pictures to the journal as well.  There are several ways you can use this, but I prefer to add any pictures from the to day to my daily journal entry.  Some of the other features include being able to add or include other types of media to your entry.  Although I personally do not use this feature, it is cool to know its there.

I paid for the app years ago before they changed to the subscription model, got over thousands entries in it. Suddenly my photo upload limited to only 1 per entry today, and was required to subscribe for premium if I want the original features back. Not gonna use Day One anymore for this reason, if they can do it to the old users, they can do whatever they like to anyone to maximise their profits any time later."
YulingMusic,11122835973,2024-04-04T20:19:17-07:00,5,Been using Day One for a few years. It’s simple and reliable. Everything works smoothly. Love that they have desktop and mobile app.

I used to love this app. I used it every single solitary day for almost a year and now I can’t log back in. I am in just the death cycle of trying and trying and trying and not getting the email sent to me for the password reset. I am really concerned because I have over 200 or more journal entries and I can’t access them or create new journal entries. I used to use the text feature to add a journal entry and it was so easy but now I can’t login. I don’t know if it’s because I got a new phone or what. But as I said, at the beginning, the help feature on this app is absolutely horrible. THEN THEY TRY TO PATHETICALLY answer / of COURSE I have an email with the login and there’s ZERO WAYS to actually get help. There’s no way to get to an actual person.

The total was $59.52 ($34.99 for Day One with a promotion, $19.99 for Me+, plus tax). I attempted to cancel and get a refund for ‘Me+’, but since it was purchased together with Day One, I couldn’t receive a partial refund. I got fully refunded $59.52 on January 18.

However, I recently discovered that I was rebilled by Apple on January 29, but I cannot access the Premium since it shows as cancelled. I can provide my bank transactions and the receipt from Apple.

Please help! I’ve tried reaching out to customer service, but there’s been no response. I haven’t been able to use the Premium features for the past three months. Can you please check?

48th Parallel,11109778640,2024-04-01T07:19:30-07:00,5,"I don’t know that this review is worth much as I have never used any other digital journal but for my many purposes, Day One is perfect.  I liked it so much I purchased another subscription for my spouse but she still prefers a paper journal with her fountain pen.  And here’s where the huge differences between the two forms really shows up.  When she wants to find the date when something happened, it’s a laborious search.  I just type the event or name or place into the search feature and I get all the hits, the most recent entry first.  With Day One I can add photos, video links, emails, texts, or even parts of daily newsletters I get as instantly as a 72 year old man can do anything instantly.  I have separate journals for books bought, borrowed, and read, for projects I’m working on, and for travelogues.  For my spouse to do any of those things is nye impossible in a paper journal just from a space standpoint.  And if I too want the feel and flow of ink on paper, which I often do, I do just that and take a photo to enter on my digital journal.
	But it’s when you’ve been at Day One for awhile that some of it’s marvelous features begin to show up.  The “On This Day” feature is a treat.  For instance, today it shows that I have four entries for today.  To click on that and discover anew what I was doing three, four, five years ago today is, in addition to being fun and informative, a daily jolt regarding the passage of time.
	Two other features I love about Day One is that it syncs my journal across all my devices.  I can jot down an entry on my phone when I’m waiting in line at the car wash or having lunch in a diner.  I can check on an entry from last year when I’m on the go.  The other thing I prize is the privacy.  My Day One is password protected which allows me to be a little more free with personal details than I otherwise would be.
	Does Day One have some warts.  I’ve yet to meet an app that doesn’t but, again, for my needs this things I would like different are so few that I haven’t even bothered mentioning them to management.  I hope I’ve made it clear why I think this app deserves five stars."
lmatt12,11104518769,2024-03-30T19:59:31-07:00,5,Love this journal and look at it everyday.  I’ve been writing in it for 12 years now. I go look at what I was doing this day for the last 12 years. I don’t even remember some of the thing I wrote and I’m so glad for each and every memory. Thanks Day One for a quality product.
Sheila Burns,11103173456,2024-03-30T10:59:41-07:00,5,"One of the features I love, having used Day One for several years, is that it lets me know I have previous entries from same date in years past and of  gives me access to read entries from same dates in years past. 
 Day One also has a search feature that easily helps me to find topics that I wrote about last week or last year."
Macorin,11099772681,2024-03-29T13:03:54-07:00,2,"I bought Day One for iOS and OSX but didn’t feel the need to purchase a subscription. I would have if it offered features I couldn’t live without, but it doesn’t, so why spend the money unnecessarily? I’ve rated this app two stars because the journal is good, even if buggy at times. I couldn’t go more than two stars because I don’t think it’s right that they reserve live support for subscriptions only. I paid money for your apps and should be able to get support when needed. I can see giving subscription members priority support and making others wait longer, but to not offer live support to those that have supported and purchased your products before subscriptions were even a thing is just wrong. If a subscription offered me something I needed, I’d buy it, but I don’t need to add more than ten photos or videos to my entries. And I certainly won’t pay just to get support. In fact, that alone is reason enough to never buy the subscription. You might as well call your subscription a support plan, not a subscription."

I first got so annoyed that I started to reverse my order of journal entries so that the first thing I could do when I opened Word was write my newest journal entry! It eventually got so messy and long though, so then I thought, “there’s GOT to be something else out there!!! This is the 21st century for Christ’s sake!!!” Then, I opened the App Store and found Day One, and my life was literally changed forever, and I could not be more thankful for this app!!! ?????? I’m currently using Day One’s free premium trial, and it’s so great that I wish so so badly I could make my own money bc if I did, I would TOTALLY pay for a subscription immediately!!!

I was so excited to use the new and improved version; however, it is constantly (and by constantly, I mean with each and every use) crashing. No matter what I try to do (write a new entry, look at historical entries etc) or where I try to do it (iPhone vs iPad), the app freezes, and the only way to fix the issue is to close the app and go back in. Further, even when I am typing on the new app, there is a big lag in the words. Please please please fix this. This app would be perfect if only it didn't freeze all the time!"

Yogiini Carolyn,11085342173,2024-03-25T14:29:26-07:00,5,"I keep about 12 sub journals concurrently with salient topics.  It has become a lifesaver for me as well as an easy way to check on a particular subject.

When I suffered with serious digestive issues, I started one titled Gastrointestinal.  Appointments with my gastroenterologist were very disappointing because he would say, “No coffee.”  Then when I read his notes concerning our office visits he would reiterate that the colonoscopies were unremarkable but I was described as labile.
     That really made me angry.  Of course I’m labile, if you were going through what I’m dealing with you would be labile, too!   I was actually contemplating how I could leave this plant without it looking like suicide.  It was that bad. 
     I thought, “OK, Buddy, you are about to get some journal entries.”  I copied about four horrendous days of entries and gave them to the receptionist for him to read before my next appointment.  They became part of my health record so they couldn’t be ignored.  
    Outcome:  he ordered an upper GI, lower GI and stool sample.  At last I was heard.  Result:  no pancreatic digestive enzymes and I needed supplementation.  I was normal at last after years of agony.
     If you have a chronic condition and are being gaslighted, I urge you to keep a journal on the symptoms and and how they are impacting your life.  Tell your story and be honest and graphic.  Dates and times and related events are important and helpful for diagnosis."

cpoetree,11081634725,2024-03-24T13:44:56-07:00,5,"Day One provides space and encouragement for more than a memoir, a diary or a daily journal.

With a provocative prompt for each day and the possibility to include images, it offers space for musing and personalizing life as we live it.

It is beautifully formatted, allowing search, dating and recall to happen easily.  Also, when one runs into a snag (and I have) help is readily available.  I have found it to be clear and effective.

If I could afford it, I would readily choose to update my Day One to premium.  Although I cannot, using Day One on a primary level is a delight this daily user would not miss.

Day One helps me grow!  Thank you to those who created it, maintain it and update it!  I'm beyond grateful."

With that, I purchased the premium, and since have experienced numerous quirks which have caused me to alter my opinion.

Far too frequently I have received “are you happy with your experience?” pop ups as I’m trying to utilize the app which appear in inconvenient locations (like over something I’m reading or trying to write)..and if that was annoying enough,..they have seldom worked, or went away, literally blocking my screen!!

Other times,..things I’ve clicked on direct to other places on the app I was not intending to see!

I would not be concerned about any of this had I not paid!

So unless they correct these bugs soon, I’ll be cancelling my subscription and would greatly warn anyone from paying for the premium package."

I tell people about it all the time because I have nothing but good things to say. There are so many features that I love about it! Just so incredibly well designed.

I’ve never loved something so much in my life. Writing has become part of my daily routine. The journal categories allow you to compartmentalize so many things and the fact that you can make notes on your phone to deep dive into later on the PC is just phenomenal. I can take create an entry while walking at the park and make quick notes of a podcast I’m listening to, then recall and complete the whole idea when I get home. If thoughts start creeping in while laying bed and I’m having difficulty falling asleep, again I can make a quick entry to dump the idea from my brain, and sleep comfortably knowing I can address the next morning on the pc. There’s just so much utility with this app. I love it. If I ever become a famous writer, this will be mentioned as one of my favorite and most valuable purchases of all time."

Here are the things I really like about Day One -

— can use across all my devices with ease
— I am able to copy, forward and even create PDFs of my entries when needed - this was a big let down with the apple journal app… I started using that until I realized that you cannot copy or export anything once it is in their app. 
— picture tagging - love that the app automatically goes to the pictures with the same date(s) as the journal entry.  Makes it so simple.
— hashtag capability - makes this easy to organize my journal in a way my mind works
—automatically imports instagram posts (now, we just need it to do the same for facebook - that’s where I posted a lot of my stuff before) 

Enhancements I would like to see:
—facebook post integration
—bible app integration would be AMAZING"

However last week I was scammed and lost access to my Apple ID. The scammers locked me out of it. I had to get a new id. I wrote to the support email explaining the situation and got back a template email with links to their FAQs- and said they only give individual support to those who pay. You call that good customer service? I don’t. I won’t be using their app again. I heard from the developer but I am still not satisfied. In fact, I am very angry. Any link you provide to offer help is a link to the help page. Option 1 is the Help guides which are links to articles and tutorials. Option 2 is the DayOne forum, but In order to write to the forum you must have an account on Wordpress-something I don’t care to have- even if the first year is free. The only other option on the page is for premium users, of which I was one but cannot use it because I lost the use of my AppleID. As I said above, I won’t be back.

I was in a dark place in life and was told to journal my thoughts before bed each day but was too lazy actually write on paper ( True Statement ??) BUT with One Day you can type out your thoughts and it’s faster, easier, on your device to ensure you don’t have to keep up with a journal, and it has helped me tremendously!"
Davey8,11022413030,2024-03-08T09:47:38-07:00,3,"I had a very, very good run going several years ago. For some reason, my 144 days of diary entries disappeared one day, and I couldn’t do anything to restore them.

This broke a habit I had fought hard to pick up. I had brainstorming going on in some of those 144 entries—story ideas I wanted to revisit and expand on. They’re long gone now, and I’m just now getting over the anger, frustration, and sadness of all my lost material.

That being said, I can’t rate this app less than three stars. It’s still a neat little app."

dmin98,11016359107,2024-03-06T16:53:49-07:00,4,"The latest update with the shared journal feature is fantastic! However, I've noticed a limitation that affects its usability for me. While I appreciate the ability for friends to comment on my journal entries, it would be immensely helpful if they could also co-edit them. Currently, they're only able to comment, leaving us to work on the journal separately rather than collaboratively. Adding the option for friends to edit entries would greatly enhance our ability to work on the journal together. Thank you for considering this feature addition!"
whowantssoup,11013442531,2024-03-05T21:49:04-07:00,5,I’ve been a day one user for three years and it’s still the best app for the job. I love how easily it sinks across my devices. Your journal can be as complex or simple as you want.
uttufxuxu,11013209719,2024-03-05T19:58:38-07:00,5,"Day one is the best journal app because you can add photos write about your day and after a year or so you can see your memories and you’ll never forget them. It has an option if you want notifications or not and doesn’t just automatically send them to you. I can unwind my day before I go to sleep and it’s the best way to do that! It also improves your typing and grammar but you don’t even work at it, you just get on the habit over time. Overall you should get this app because it’s a helpful app that gets me to sleep every night and brings myself up looking at the good parts of my day."

LDesiena,11011471875,2024-03-05T08:48:21-07:00,4,The only downside of the app is the less than good Apple Pencil for writing for the day. You have to do by drawing. Could be better. I have used the app for years. Overall a good app.

CosmicNoidPizza,10982861105,2024-02-26T12:18:35-07:00,1,"Used to love Day One, but will be unsubscribing and uninstalling because I don’t trust my data being used by a transmisogynist CEO who breaches user data privacy just so he can make funny comebacks on Twitter, as well as making me pay $32/y for basic quality of life features like multiple journals. 

Switching to Diarium from here on out - it has just about everything Day One has, doesn’t require a subscription (only a one time fee for the same features Day One subscription-walls), plus it’s not run by people who gladly house transphobes and other bigots on their social media platforms."

I loved being able to journal whatever I want. However, I quickly realized it was lacking features such as the ability to back up entries outside of the app. I discovered Day One as an alternative. The app does every thing I need and more. I do think that there is some features that could be added on for quality of life. I hope the app keeps improving."

Annchm,10965943554,2024-02-21T22:06:29-07:00,5,"Finally, I found the journal I’m looking for. This is the easiest journal in the world. The thing that I like most about this journal is that I have been used to using a five-year journal where I could see every year previous. I couldn’t find an online one that did this. This journal does! It shows you a year in review. I haven’t made it yet, but I’m happy to know that it’ll show me what I’ve done in previous years on the same day. A great journal! So easy to use."
houstonbruce,10952701238,2024-02-18T06:20:18-07:00,5,"UPDATE: February 2024
I really enjoy Day One. They make it convenient to journal. I also have a text reminder that reminds me, daily, to write. It is so convenient to do this, and often, I copy and paste messages I have written others, into my journaling process. Why write things twice.

One feature I want to explore more of is family journaling, but I am not sure my family would want to do this. 

Templates make things easier if you have repetitive forms of journaling in mind. 

UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2023 I do not really have any complaints with this app. It does what it says, and I feel that my data and personal information is reasonably-secure. I like being able to text my entries. Helpful if I have already written something I want to document that I have written to family or friends via text message. That was a feature I really liked—the ability the app had to ask if I wanted to open the application after using iOS Share Sheet to post a journal entry. If it went away, please bring it back. It is super-helpful to have the option to click and just go directly into the app."

It gives me a chance to reflect on each day and reminds me of the good things and experiences in my life.  The ability to add photos and memories is fantastic.
As I said it’s been 80 days since I started journaling and look forward to years as this is a great way to diary and reflect on your life experiences."
McCarthyAero,10948782130,2024-02-17T05:49:27-07:00,3,"I like the format for the most part. For some reason - perhaps a bug - entry’s will not record. The process goes like this. Hit the “plus” to begin the entry, type, perhaps a few photos. Hit “done” - poof! Gone. The entry is not saved. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. Frustrating."
OnHD,10938132431,2024-02-14T07:11:49-07:00,1,"I’m a PLUS legacy user. I find their weather service is in accurate and I don’t want my historical journal entries to be incorrect. That seems incompatible with why one journals to begin with. I’ve asked Support if I can disable the weather service entirely. However they declined to answer my question because I’m not a premium user I paid money for the version of the app that I use, and as a paying customer I expect some level of support at least for simple questions. I’m not pleased that this developer has chosen to ignore needs of non-premium paid users. I found you could ask this question of their automated online chat bot, and you get an answer, it’s just an answer that is not true, and it directs you to take steps with features that don’t exist.
2/14/24 Update: I did receive a developer response in informing me that my Plus plan was discontinued nine years ago. I’m well aware of that. My point was, while the plan may have been discontinued, I still purchased the app and the developer has my money. It’s my feeling that there should be some “support” quid pro quo connected to that fact, otherwise the developer has simply stiffed a paid customer. Don’t get me wrong, I still love the app and will continue to use it, as it far surpasses anything it’s competitors offer. I just feel cheated on the Support issue, and I think others should be aware of that."

macbookpro15,10934348008,2024-02-13T06:17:26-07:00,2,So I’ve used day one for the last 2 years and I have had a premium membership with them. Unfortunately the app quality has gone down over time with the app having a lot of bugs. This I understand to some extent however their support is very bad too. The turn around time for answers is over a week I have had several tickets with them and the answering took forever and at the end of the day their support engineers are just not equipped to do proper support. I literally figured out two issues on my own when their support was unable to help me one was with ordering a book and the other one was with the payment failing. In both cases doing a clean install and losing all the books I prepared fixed the issue. I think if they want to be around for a longer period of time they need to step up their game and go back to how they used to be.

Retirwneercs,10909836423,2024-02-06T13:21:06-07:00,5,"Love your app and using it forever. Can’t say enough good things about it, but I do have one issue I would like you to address and that is could you make the scrubber bar on the iPhone etc I noticed it’s white. Could you make it a color so it stands out more. I missed it for the longest time before I realized it was even there. Just saying. It’s great when you scrub and the date appears next to it that makes it supper easy to find a particular date. Thats really smart. Thanks for an exceptional app

Oh yea almost forgot…Is there anyway you could do the find function so it’s highlighted? Whenever you do a find for something you need to look through the whole entire entry to see where it’s at as it’s never highlighted in yellow etc like most apps do. Is that a possibility to change that? I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for your great work."
Geekgirl1971,10907585644,2024-02-06T00:20:19-07:00,3,I’m very disappointed and upset with this app. I recorded my first audio recording last night. Then I went through the written dictation and corrected the grammar issues and mistakes it made with what I said. A process that took me 20-30 mins to fix. I hit done and it appeared to save. A few moments later I realized my entire entry just vanished. I’ve looked everywhere on my account and found nothing. What is the point of using this app if it doesn’t store my recordings. And how do I get to the cloud part of the app that’s showing at the top of the page? I sent a message through the contact us area but no one has bothered to respond. I’m not going to pay for an app that wastes my time and efforts.

1,497 streak today. The app keeps getting better. Now I can look back on 4 years of memories. It has been an easy process for me. Every morning after I do my daily devotional I do my entry from what I did the day before. Having the pictures to look back on is priceless. It’s also a good tool to look back on when I got my oil changed in my truck or when I fertilized the yard, etc by using the search feature. Love the app!"

I stated that another good friend has kept a journal since he was a boy. She told me… “It’s never too late to start!”

I started this journal that day, as a way of logging information for my grandchildren when they are older.  

Over the last 900 plus days, I’ve expanded how I use it to log a record of health related items.  I keep adding other things too.  Any time I have something that I think could be noteworthy, I log it.  For example something that might be useful in documentation of a legal matter or whatever.  

Lastly I make sure to log every day.  In addition to keeping track of my weight and exercise I’ve done, I’ve set a goal to actually do something during the day that is noteworthy.   Another way to say that is to make sure I don’t have to disappoint myself by stating that I didn’t do anything today!"

L Shax,10862657418,2024-01-25T07:11:04-07:00,5,"OK, I am not a big journal writer, but the Day One app has so many capabilities and is so easy to use that I just love it!

I keep a regular photo journal here where I put time stamped curated photos, and this can be done at the end of each day, or a month later when you have some free time or are home sick or whatever. I also use this to jot down some story about an event or day f I want.

On any given day, I will snap a few pictures of something that brings me joy to include in this journal. I don't need to worry if the photo is 'good' or if anyone else will like it. It is just for me!  When I go back through my phone camera roll, most days have something, and there are fond memories!

This is also great for journalling trips, etc. 

I also keep a private journal (both are private, but this one double-checks before showing any previews on my screen), and this is where I vent, complain, record frustrating experiences, etc. It is so much easier to move on from something if you have documented how it made you feel. This journal helps me move past this, but also allows me to go back and process as needed, and can be a helpful reference for therapy sessions. 

Oh, there is also a email option where I can type an entry into an email that will send directly into my journal. I use this for longer entries. 

I really like having a separate app for all of this to avoid feeling like it might be a Google or Apple product that I might feel stuck with later."
TimM8c,10859592779,2024-01-24T11:04:28-07:00,5,I have been using Day One since 2017.  I find it so useful in so many ways.  I use it for a day to day list  at the end of my day to remember daily events.  I use it for different workshops and classes I attend.  For poetry writing.  For a prayer journal.  I love the search feature.  I used to keep handwritten journals but then lost track of things I had written.  I do wish there was an easier way to transfer a document into a word document.  Other than that I highly recommend this journal.

I don’t have social media, so it’s always nice to see the memories pop up on here. I recently tried out other journal apps to see if they could be a replacement, but none of them work for me."
pbg5194,10858430396,2024-01-24T04:45:47-07:00,1,"Just downloaded this app. Did the free trial.  Unless I haven’t found it yet, there seems to be no way to make entries special, more attractive.  It is very bland.  Boring.  Would like to see ways to change the look of the calendar, add stickers of some kind, etc.. Anything to make this app a little more exciting. I’m going to try it out as is and see what I think after the free trial."
WiFeLo,10857414504,2024-01-23T21:49:44-07:00,4,"This is a really good journaling app! I like that it’s easy to use. However, I would like for there to be additional formatting options. Currently there are no options for varying text/font color and general formatting (i.e.-centering text). It would be nicer if these options were available."

And I forget about the entries from years ago until i take the time to go over them and its nice to be able to have old memories and details of those days. The only caveat is the yearly subscription but well worth the price.

I’ve lost interest in the public aspect and paper journals are almost more than I want to do on a daily basis. I found Day One through the Wonder Tools newsletter and decided to try it out. 

It’s packed with features. Even if you don’t know what to write, there are handy templates and prompts to help you develop a writing habit. For me, it’s therapeutic and helps me work out things in my life through thought and documentation. 

I really can’t recommend it enough."

ContentDriven,10827514216,2024-01-15T22:59:39-07:00,1,"I understand the developers are iOS ones. I understand the web version is in Beta. However, I cannot understand how they expect people to type a 1-2 page journal every day on their phone. This doesn’t make sense at all. Yes, the app is nice with lots of features, but there has to be a PC version, or at least a web version that does’t look like an 8 grader designed and developed it. Especially when Day One is the most expensive journal “solution” out there. Honestly, I have no idea why people give this a 5 star, but I bet my life they are all Mac users. Deleted."

I use the premium version so I can make entries on my iPad, which I find easier to flow into typing with. But I don’t always have my iPad, I do always have my phone however. I journal on my phone whenever I don’t have my iPad, or don’t have the energy to sit down and type for ten minutes. I have always wanted to journal daily, but the lack of access to my physical journal everyday made that hard. Day One makes that excuse negligible."

Staring at an empty page and feeling the need to write something profound. Or journal prompts I found didn’t really resonate or inspire me. I recently found Day One and I’m addicted! It’s only day 6 and I already have 17 entries. The prompts allow me to explore and be curious. Even though I’ve reused journal prompts on different days, it’s never boring. Each day brings new opportunities and obstacles and so the prompts feel brand new. I cannot tell you how much this app has helped with my mental health and overall happiness. This is literally the second review I’ve ever written but I had to because it was so important to me. Download it!! You won’t regret it."

I tried fixing it by turning off the iPhone and even deleted and reinstalled the app a couple of times but that didn't work, then. 

I next contacted the apps help line and got a message back that my problem would be passed on to their tech people.

Today I tried again to make a new entry on the iPhone app and it still froze so then I tried deleting the app and afterwards turning off my iPhone for five minutes.

When I reinstalled Day One app on my iPhone and waited till after it synced with icloud downloading all my past entries I again tried to make a new entry and this time it worked!

I  guess that the apps tech must have been working on it so my deleting the app and reinstalling it this time worked,  so if you have the same problem try it!

I have been using this app for years now and this is the first time I have had a problem with it so thanks!"

If using the pencil, entry will not scroll up and you are stuck trying to write in a very crunched space and trying not to hit pencil keys.

Unusable - I did contact support and they confirmed the issue.  Terrible development and QC for user interface.  This should have been addressed before release if they wanted to have customers using iPads."

I pay for premium and don’t know if I’d use it without all of the amazing features — I use it online for typing long updates but mostly I use the mobile app. I upload pictures, videos and voice recordings. I often dictate voice to text. I really like the ability to have multiple journals for different purposes. Does everything I need it to, and I feel a huge relief that I’m finally capturing the important details of life again.

UsefulReviewsNow,10764437988,2023-12-30T15:00:30-07:00,4,"The journaling concept is amazing. It meets all my needs and is by far the best free app of its kind. Unfortunately, there are a lot of drawbacks if you don’t choose the premium plan, which is roughly $36/year. For instance, if you don’t want to splurge on premium, you can not add videos or multiple photos into one entry. It is to be noted that you can add one photo per entry without premium. Also, there is no cross-device sharing without premium. You can’t start on your phone and end on your Mac unless you pay the price.

Overall, these don’t detract from an otherwise enjoyable journaling experience, but without premium, the line is thin between Day One and the standard Apple Notes app."

carrie3630,10759127176,2023-12-29T07:24:15-07:00,5,"I’ve been using DayOne for years and it just gets better and better. It is so easy to start a journal entry. DayOne is integrated across the iOS platform, so you can quickly send photos, articles, or inspiration from around the internet to your journal. The tagging and searching are top notch. You can even create separate journals for different projects or themes.

One of the best features is the location, weather, and activity logging that seamlessly integrate into new entries. When I’m out and about, I take a lot of pictures, but don’t always add them to DayOne the same day. When I create a new entry, I can add the photos and am immediately prompted to apply the photo date and location, so it keeps everything in order.

I love how the developer keeps making DayOne better. I know Apple has launched their own journalling app, but I’m committed to this wonderful app that has stood the test of time and is now a daily feature in my life."

I trusted this app to not crash and eat 2 hours of working on an entry, and that’s exactly what happened to me. I’m on an M1 iPad Pro. I am so displeased right now."

Day One is a little different than Evernote, but just as useful.  I have almost 50 journals on various topics and time periods.  I use the app to keep track of my business and my nonprofit.  I take notes for the books I’m writing.  I use Day One to remember important things.  My entries often use pictures, videos, and audio files.  The whole thing is searchable.  It is my brain, stored on a handy device in my pocket.  For 2024, I plan to use Day One even more, recording notes and thoughts from almost every aspect of my life.  It is effortless to use.  I hope it remains just the way it is, for many years into the future.  One improvement I wouldn’t mind would be if the voice to text was a little more accurate sometimes.  It gets about 90% of the words right, and I can usually make the corrections pretty quickly.  I wish every app I use was this dependable, versatile, and useful."

I love writing, but I have always struggled with sitting down to write and getting overwhelmed while staring at a blank page. This app has a dictation feature which allows me to speak freely while the app transcribes it in real time. You can then go back and edit later. This is incredibly useful to me in the mornings, when most of my ideas hit me, but I have very little time to write them down because I’m getting ready for work. This app allows you to record and leave it running so you can simply talk at your device when you have something that you want to write down. There are many incredibly useful features in here, but the transcription is the one that wins the day for me. I highly recommend giving this app a try if you are a writer at heart, but struggle either with time or feeling overwhelmed in figuring out where to start."

One standout feature is the effortless insertion of media from the current date, allowing me to easily enhance my memories. Additionally, Day One offers simple markdown support, enabling me to format my entries exactly how I want them. 
The inclusion of daily prompts adds a creative touch, sparking inspiration for my journaling journey. I particularly appreciate the ""On this day"" pop-ups that remind me of my thoughts and experiences from a year ago, giving me a chance to reflect and appreciate my own growth. Furthermore, Day One rewards users for creating streaks, encouraging consistency in journaling.

Its developers never listened to users and called us “vocal minority” when we asked for something THEY did not like. Removed all the great features from the app, photo stream was great once, now it’s no different from regular photo app, limited many features under subscription. Broke the book printing (our family bought a plan and tried 5 times to print the book - never worked, support couldn’t help). So it brings us to the present day with an app crippled by its own creator. Well, classic human story with its roots in the ancient scriptures."

A password recovery email was sent, I followed the link, and it would open up a Chrome tab directly to my account.

Which means that someone would merely need to have my email and request an account recovery and have direct access to my day one account on Chrome.

As an extension, the password recovery would do as I have outlined above and to change my password I wouldn’t have to reenter the password that I forgot.

Now they just made the previous app unusable and replaced it with this new one so that they could get more money. Original app you paid once and you were done. Now they try to make you pay a monthly fee for “premium” to get basically the same thing as what I already owned. They don’t even offer like a curtesy credit for the users who had paid for the previous app. They didn’t do any of this to benefit the consumer. They did it to get more money. Why would I pay for a monthly subscription to write like I can on the built in iPhone notes app?! Ridiculous

iOS notes
Notebooks by Afons Schmid

I’ve whittled it down to two : 
 iOS Notes and Day One.

I’ve been using iOS notes for 15 years. I have used Day One in the past. But wasn’t satisfied with it. Then they did a super upgrade to it and it appears as though it’s a strong contender for the best Notes app. I’ve compared iOS notes with Day One feature by feature, capability by capability. So far Day One is  in the lead. But it’s close. I’ll post again when I’ve decided."

Knowing that I’d inevitably randomly get signed out and get flustered and upset having to reset a password I wouldn’t remember, I chose to sign in with Apple. The app read my face and accepted it. Then…nothing. I could never get past that page even after the face scan recognized me every time. 

If just accessing the app doesn’t work correctly, how annoying is using it going to be? Deleting it right away. Disappointed, it looked fun and helpful."

Lalit Mishra,10651625209,2023-12-02T20:41:29-07:00,5,"Day One Journal App stands out as a premier digital journaling platform, providing a seamless and enriched experience for capturing life's moments. Its interface is elegantly simple, inviting users to document their thoughts and activities without the distraction of cluttered toolbars.

One of Day One's most compelling features is its versatility. Whether you're a minimalist who appreciates the one-click entry system and clean design or a detail-oriented person who enjoys cataloging entries with metadata like location, weather, and music, Day One caters to all. The app's use of templates and prompts ingeniously lowers the barrier to journaling, making it accessible even when inspiration is scarce.

For those who like to journal on-the-go, Day One's multimedia capabilities allow for a rich recording of experiences, enabling users to add photos, videos, and even audio to their entries. The app also respects the private nature of journaling, offering robust security features to protect personal musings.

Customizable reminders are another innovative aspect, helping users build a consistent journaling habit by setting multiple prompts throughout the day, tailored to their schedule.

In essence, Day One excels not just as a digital journal but as a companion for life's journey, providing a versatile, secure, and user-friendly space to document personal growth, reflect on experiences, and store memories."

Making a habit of using Day One has saved me time, lowered my anxiety, and saved me money. 
It’s worth the subscription. Get it. 

The longer version that ADHDers in particular will see themselves in and understand:

Losing time finding things, buying things you think will fix you but you never use, buying another of the thing you can’t find or forgot you already have, is the “ADHD Tax.” I’ve paid. 
(I personally consider losing writing, ideas, and pictures part of the ADHD tax.)  

Day One  is the first app (or physical book) I’ve ever used regularly. I did have to build the habit, but it wasn’t hard because Day One is effortless. 

I have many lovely journals. a couple bujos, planners, and the guilt from not using them. 
I used to have a lot of stuff “somewhere” and had to go on a safari every time I needed any of it. 

I use Day One for journaling, saving ideas for projects, corralling spicy social media drafts and angry emails safely away from that “send” button, cataloging stuff in bins, boxes, and baskets, venting, pet pictures, and checklisting.  
It’s a boss feeling when you think, “Where is the (insert thing  here)?” and I can look it up, see it’s in Bin 3, grab it, and get back to what I was doing. 
Day One has tagging so it’s even easier to find that #blue faux fur or tell yourself #Go Me. 

My one and only beef  is that Day One is a subscription instead of a purchase. I’d love a version I could buy and set to back up to Dropbox or my personal cloud storage. 
On the other hand, this year’s cost of using Day One is definitely less than an unused planner and replacing a jacket."

I'd be much more consistent in journaling if I was just able to access it through the internet with a desktop.

If anyone has any other features they would like to tell me that would be great! Thanks!

dj anthony lovell,10593827508,2023-11-16T22:04:57-07:00,5,I was waiting for Apple’s journal app. But I wanted to get things moving so with a little research I got day one. I’m really happy with the app. It does way more than what I need. But I’m still curious to see what Apple has to offer in this space.
Reesa225,10593014572,2023-11-16T15:33:43-07:00,5,"Loving this app and the fact that you can attach pictures to your entries is awesome. I love how it shows a month view of all the days you’ve journaled. When trying to create a habit of journaling, this is a great way to see if your on track. I also really like the prompts. I love pen and paper, but it’s not always easy to pull out a notebook and track down a pen, but a cell phone, thats usually close by. This app has really changed my journaling habits for the better."
MissLadylike,10590586523,2023-11-15T23:10:36-07:00,3,"I like the app because it’s been helpful in leading me back to journaling. But I don’t understand why there’s a $34.99 per year fee to use it and access  features like uploading multiple photos or media. I would be willing to pay a one time cost to own it, but paying $34.99 a year can get expensive depending on how long  you use it. You can get a similar experience using the Notes app on iPhone for free."
LNW LLC,10590226494,2023-11-15T20:07:53-07:00,5,I was a fan of journaling on paper for years and just wanted to experiment with something different. 2 years later and this has elevated the way in which I'm able to record the events and moments of my life. It even allowed me to complete some projects collecting audio messages from family members to keep in memory of them forever. Love this app
Bryan Caban,10586796256,2023-11-14T19:56:55-07:00,5,I love this app and I find it useful. Also love that it needs a password to be opened so that your entries remain private.

But a couple weeks ago I noticed a button inviting me to turn on  automatic sync. Well. BEWARE. When I did that, my journal of many years, all the entries and the journal itself, GONE. 
I have read the blogs and sleuthed to find an old backup in Time Machine, and that got me everything except this year and I just lost my father and had journaled that journey. Gone. I’ve tried contacting 3 times now and no one answers their email. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this company."

I love this app though, it helps me keep track of what times I have dips in my medicine, what time of the months I get sad, helps me organize my ADHD thoughts, and keeps my privacy.  I love how I can make unlimited  entries and each one has a time stamp."
LuvAmore,10581835264,2023-11-13T08:18:21-07:00,1,"There are a lot of bells and whistles that encourages journaling, which I love, but Some users love the idea of digital journal with the old-school handwriting option. For years, I’ve tried, but the single page at a time is not a great setup, and half-baked support with scribble is not good at all. I prefer writing and find myself doing so in a different app and then screenshots into DayOne. It's not a great workflow.  All advertised input options should be tested and meet a minimum baseline.

However, with the voice dictation feature I’m able to express my thoughts in words. Talk about my day or an event that I want to detail what’s happening. This app help me do that. I will encourage anyone with a learning disability or a person that may not physically be able to type to use the app. I encourage teachers to have just students use this app, if they do daily journals as part of their lesson.

It helps me see that as much as there is to do, we have done a lot in the last five years. That is motivating. I really want to pay the developer for this wonderful app and perhaps get more premium features. But the $35/year price point/model is just not who I am. I prefer to pay once, while I have the money. I like expensive tools, and I love using 30 year old tools because the value. I don’t like subscriptions because my attention comes and goes and I don’t like committing my future earnings just to read my diary. Other apps do offer single fee OR subscription models, and I purchased them."

One other bonus feature for me, if I happen to get busy and forget to send a photo with a comment, it will ask if I want to backdate it to the photo date. So far the only drawback is the look is a bit rudimentary and hard to really view on phone, no options. But this is my go to for documenting my day."

This makes it so simple to vent and clear my head and get my thoughts organized on ¨paper¨ in no time and I am truly grateful for this app.

The prompts are genuine as well and they blend well with normal journal entries.  I truly love this."

sterlingts,10550151365,2023-11-04T11:52:11-07:00,5,"This app is EVERYTHING I need in a journaling app, and so much more! I’ve always been a pen to paper kind of journalist. One day I was sitting by a small river, with 3 different notebooks. As I was writing, I slipped a little bit on a rock, and almost dropped my notebook. I thought to my self, if I were to drop this notebook in the water, I’d lose everything in here. That made me think, maybe it’s time to go digital. At least it would all be backed up. I’ll fast forward a bit~ I tried several different apps, and I landed here. This app allows me to have everything in one place, it allows me to add pictures, songs, and really anything! It plays seamlessly between my computer, and phone (I pad if I wanted) and the convenience is incredible. It tracks where I made the entry, and the time (I’ve always had an interesting fascination with starting my entries with the date and exact time I’m journaling because I feel it captures the moment in it’s entirety. I’m writing this review at 11:37AM). It even captures the weather, which I suppose isn’t important (to me) but a fun detail. Ok, I’m trailing here~ this app is amazing, and I suggest you find out the features for yourself! I’m a daily journalist and this app lets me categorize everything exactly as I need it. I can search, and reference things as needed. I couldn’t possibly be more happy with an app! Everything is backed up, twice, and you can get your journals printed if you want them on the shelf! I haven’t used this feature yet, but I know the time will come. I do miss the tactile feel of writing on paper, but for what this app offers, the pros heavily outweigh the cons!!!!! At times when paper is what’s available,  I find my self taking a picture of the entry and logging it into the app. HERE’S YOUR SIGN, MAKE THE SWITCH. I can, nearly, guarantee you won’t regret it! I like that i have the option to password lock the app, because this is for me, and only me. I could go on, and on, but I’ll end this here. THIS IS THE ONLY APP I HAVE THAT I CAN SAY HAS TRULY CHANGED MY LIFE. For how much I journal, and what this app offers, I will gladly pay the subscription price :) JUST DO IT!"
smithjasonrichard,10548805364,2023-11-04T04:44:11-07:00,5,I’ve tried a bunch of different journal apps. I’ve tried different methods of journaling by hand. This app is better all around than everything.

Yet I wanted access to all my journaling! Them a fellow nomad introduced me to Day One. I have been using it ever since! When I am back with my old stack of journals I can scan in past entries and add them to my archive! I also love the photos options. This has allowed me to save special photos for later review and reduce my posting on social media where I used to put pictures I wanted so keep with special notes.

I love writing journal entries with it.
I think the free version of Day One should let user sync their journal entries across all of their devices.
Instead of including it in the premium version.
All in all, I recommend this app because it is fully accessible with the voiceover screenreader.
Giving Day One five stars."

Day One is the place where everything comes together - all links (music, video, pdf, photos) bookmarks, accounting, reading, recipes, journaling. Give it a spin and find a central repository with security options for everything - an uncluttered running diary of life so you can get back to living it. Free up brain space for creative, enjoyable endeavors rather than searching for stored info across too many platforms. The tagging and multiple journal capabilities are the key to your freedom.

Update: a great app to store Freeform boards as pdfs.  

Syncing is seamless across the Apple ecosystem and love making audio notes and journals which can be AI transcribed."

Basic level no longer allows addition of a photo. With basic you can add a photo to an entry which has worked for me for as long as I have used the app (almost 8 years). The latest version of the app asks you to sign up for premium when you try to add the photo. Help pages are useless as you have to sign up for a Wordpress domain to use the forums. And then you can’t log in that way either. No way to contact support other than a chatbot which asks you, again, to sign up for premium. I really like this app but this is a step backwards."

I've been using the Day One app for some time now, and I must say, I'm a huge fan. It's an excellent tool for digital journaling, offering a plethora of features that make it stand out. The seamless integration with various media types, robust tagging system, and intuitive interface are all top-notch.

However, there's one area where I find room for improvement—the Apple Pencil experience. As someone who enjoys a more handwritten journaling approach, I was hoping for a smoother and more immersive experience. Currently, the app allows for drawing and basic writing, but it doesn't quite capture the essence of a true handwritten journaling experience.

I believe that a substantial update in this aspect would be a game-changer. If the app could enhance the handwriting capabilities to provide a more natural and fluid writing experience, it would undoubtedly elevate the Day One app to a whole new level.

While I started with the one-month free trial, I have reservations about extending it and purchasing the upgrade, primarily due to this reason. However, I'd be more than willing to become a loyal, long-term client if this particular feature is addressed in future updates.

In summary, the Day One app is fantastic, but there's a potential for perfection in the handwriting department. With some tweaks and updates, this app could easily become a five-star favorite for many, including myself.

It’s now became my habit to write whenever I’m feeling good or bad. Love it so much"

funindasun998,10451898641,2023-10-08T04:38:01-07:00,5,I have been using it now for several years.  I enjoy being able to have several different journals for variety of areas of my life.
DrFunk,10448471716,2023-10-07T05:29:34-07:00,5,"I saw a video where a photographer was taking two seconds out of each day for a whole year and put it together in a few minutes of a movie. The images went flashing by in high speed, but your minds eye could capture the moment, and it was a memory brought forward. Fascinating how a short  movie was able to remind you of the whole year. I was all excited and thought I needed to do this however, that’s a lot of editing! So I found this app and decided that using the dictation system on the iPhone, and this app, I would start to record, the salient features of each day. I felt like life is going by too fast so I needed to record it. That was in 2019. Boy was I right because since then we’ve had multiple years of Covid, death in the family, issues at work and a national awards that my daughter got, all recorded in it in this app. After losing my wife, I’m so glad I have images and jokes and things to remember her by. I started recording 4 years before her death and now wish I had done this at the beginning. The app works flawlessly and I will continue to do so. I record a little something and some photo of each day. The stuff I want to remember and even the stuff I want to forget because I don’t wanna do that again! I finally printed out five books by now, so I have them on paper on my shelf. Time is your most valuable asset and we don’t record the events very well, thinking that will remember it all. Looking back at the books I can tell you those books are priceless. Thank you Day One."
M&TJones,10446713855,2023-10-06T16:42:20-07:00,5,"When I first bought this app it was on a whim as I was searching for a way to log my weight loss progress. I am not much of a journalist nor have I ever been, so I didn’t anticipate me keeping the app for a long period of time. Given that I would write about my efforts and then some other topic, then another, and another. It has now been years that I have had this app and I use it at least three times weekly. It’s simple to use on both my computer or phone. Thank you for the memories."

therealpeculiarmom,10441137758,2023-10-05T04:48:36-07:00,5,"I’m using it in conjunction with Neurocycle app. Day one allows me to pour my true feeling thoughts into a journal without concern for it being read by someone. 
It locks you out every time which is good. Using facial recognition to open makes it easy. I can write out pages on paper and take a picture and load into my journal. It allows only one picture per journal entry on the free version. That seems fair."
slp591,10435696843,2023-10-03T16:51:16-07:00,5,I love this app it chronicles my life in such an accessible way. I love that I can attach pics and it show’s location of each entry.

I have it on my iPhone & MacBook. I’ll make my journal entries, add pictures that I love & it’s basically like an electronic scrapbook. The way the app is set up, it makes you want to post an entry. I subscribe to the premium version too. I’m obsessed."

The flexibility for several journals, the colors, fonts, indents, dates, media possibilities, editing capabilities are all delightful. I love being able to easily transfer an entry from one journal to another. This is one subscription I gladly pay for each year!

Update 9/30/23 - still absolutely in love with Day 1 Journal app!!!"

I journal when it feels right. When I’m happy, when I’m sad, when I wake up from a confusing dream. It allows me the freedom to express myself when it need it most.

Also, I have two phones and they sync instantly and with full accuracy. That means it doesn’t matter what phone I have with me, or is nearest to me, I’m always up to date. 5 stars."
KatWalk65,10421441594,2023-09-29T18:15:37-07:00,5,"For a long time, I resisted this app because I already use Evernote, drafts, bear and too many archives of paper journals to want another journal. This deliberate chronicle, albeit digital, has its own set of new nightmares (e.g. losing brilliant drafts never to be recovered in this lifetime; 99 CENT pay wall hitting at that critical juncture where poverty and verisimilitude collide to disrupt the latest masterpiece with a Mephisto phenomenon option: or else!)

 I like the interface, platform, obvious intention & execution of this app. The ""interface"" to me means how I interact with the digital input of my thoughts and artist way type Journaling that I've been doing doe twenty odd years - so I want to pick up where I left off not have to adjust my creative process to some fraudulent fad, but rather seamlessly fold the ""platform"" which in this case is iphone app into my creative process. Which to some might be ""crazy"" or chaotic because I am highly creative. I don't want an application limiting the expression I have been honing over my 58 years on the planet. I appreciate the fluid format and ability to play with media within a post, love the fonts and am generally a huge fan. I went from premium at first to standard due to massive cuts in cash flow so all paid apps had to go until I could justify their value. I forsee at some point paying premium to complete an archive or print a thematic book. As a lifelong writer and photographer, a writer, Director and producer by trade and a storytelling maven by fate, I love this app and encourage writers or artist way type journal afficionadoes (those who use photorealism to convey their thoughts and emotions or visual poetry) out there to give it a try. It's pretty integrated so you can track your life archive across multiple tools and resources you already find useful in your digital dominion. I welcome the developers to set up.a forum for their loyal users to give more meaningful feedback. I'm genx and prefer contributing to projects that can best utilize my time investment. Cheers! Day in the life!"

The prompts are sometimes exactly what I need but if not I just start journaling. Well done! And thank you!

First of all it’s better for your health if you keep a diary and this is my diary. Secondly, it helps me keep a perspective on a certain situation and believes my stress level.

I can also look back at certain things and see if I’ve progressed to some thing that I had discussed attaining earlier in my life."

Use it to coalesce all your digital work into one place. It’s a scrapbook of thoughts and projects and ideas and feelings; it’s an app that allows me to explore my inner world and chronicle my outer life.

The best parts: it reminds me of journal entries I made on this date years ago; the export to PDF function; the ability to get a printed book of my entries (great quality, I use it often).

I rarely write reviews or I use apps for so long. I’ve used Day One for the past several years, and enjoyed it immensely. It’s the perfect tool for keeping a record of my life journey."

What frustrates me are some of the changes. The voice to text tech changed a few years back and never caught up with where it used to be. Yesterday I tried posting multiple photos to one entry and I could not. This is hugely frustrating as much of my entries used to be photos. Now we can only upload one photo a day? I do not use a lot of the integrations that this app can access. I just use the basic tools. Wondering if more things will be removed like the photos.

I was an early user of this software and they kept ""updating"" to new versions and pricing in a way that didn't allow for previous data to convert and increased the price level substantially. It's hopefully pretty solid today, but I lost months of information, which totally defeats the purpose of keeping a journal. They only seemed concerned about making money and not the numerous inconvenient updates and difficult to apply patches."

I can’t see the day I made that last entry, but it has been this year.

Let all who use this amazing, wonderful app to delineate your lives BEWARE. There was no warning that I would no longer be able to access my account. I think that I maybe could have downloaded my entries.

I write on my iPad quite a bit and love to use slide-over and split-screen views to jot down thoughts in my journal while I am reading my Kindle book in the background. Hard to believe that Day One still craps out once you hit one full page of content within the app. Once you finish writing a full-page in slide-over or split-screen view, you can no longer see what you are writing because the app stops scrolling with your writing. You are writing “blind” so to speak. It is really hard to believe that this problem still persists after all these years and has frustrated me on more than one occasion. Simple problem - please fix this for the love of all that is good and holy."

I wish there was a way that I could have my Spotify playlist linked up to Day One so that it would sync with what I was listening to at the time while writing my entry. So I thought this option would work however it doesn’t work. I updated the app. I looked at all my settings on my iPhone and it does not work. I don’t know if this is a feature that is not working? I have the premium subscription too so I don’t know why it’s not working. It’s become incredibly annoying.. to try to figure it out."

It’s understandable that not everyone may like it. Personally, I liked the older UI much better, but am willing to give this new layout a fair try. 

Things might be a bit buggy and wonky while we all try to adapt to this new layout, but I’m sure those other things will be taken care of in time.

 I’ve been searching around for another journal app to use and nothing still comes close to DayOne. In my opinion, this is still the best journaling app out there and as long as they don’t continue to change things that make the app less user friendly and away from the original intentions of the app, I’m still willing to stick with them. 

Even when they do big updates like these that kind of has everyone mad about the change. As long as I try to get used to the change, then I think I will feel better about it later on."
venusamaris,11352062949,2024-06-06T19:04:40-07:00,3,"Updated to add: I do not love this new version. I have been using this app for years now. I always like the touches of color on the screen. Now they have stripped away nearly all the color. Why? It is so sterile and boring, and I honestly do not see the reason for the change. Were people complaining that it was too colorful. I kind of doubt that. Change for the sake of change is always a bad idea. Nothing about this latest update has improved my experience in using it. Learn to leave a good thing alone instead of messing it up in pursuit of a “fresh new look”.

Updated to add: I love the new location function in the latest update, it was just what I was hoping for. The developers are obviously trying hard to be responsive to users. They did not ""abandon iCloud"" here or charge money for an update. This is a NEW VERSION of Day One, and if you want to use it you will have to pay all of $5 - $10 (!), and learn to live with their excellent sync service. If you love the classic Day One, keep using it. It is not going away, or being abandoned. If you want iCloud sync, stick with the Classic version, do not expect this version to meet that need. The developers have done everything possible to communicate the fact that iCloud and Dropbox would not be available in v2, and why. It makes sense to me, and if I really want to keep using iCloud sync I can stick with Day One Classic. I recommend going to the developer website and reading their blog post from a week or so ago, which outlines why the changes and what they see as the benefit of using Day One Sync instead of iCloud. I have used Day One for a few years now, and I have always loved it. Journaling is very important in my life, I have done it since I was a kid and I have boxes of paper journals archived away. The original Day One was my go-to journal from the first day I downloaded it. I was a bit worried about the impending upgrade, I tip my hat to the developers of Day One for doing it right."

Put the control buttons back at the bottom where they were. They were easier to access and made more sense.

This latest update seems to be “change for change’s sake,” rather than needed functionality improvements."

I’m typing some pretty emotional stuff and for whatever reason, I guess a slight movement of my phone, the app tries to go in landscape mode and just shows a completely jacked up display (unusable or distinguishable screen the app is displaying since it glitched out trying to switch the orientation). Nothing makes it go back to normal so I close the app completely and open it back up. And just like that the last few minutes of writing are gone. That might not seem like a big deal but when you’re just pouring into something, it’s coming from the heart, you’re not thinking about remembering what you just typed. Why would you even make the app to do that? How is that even possible? Does your app just “save” every couple minutes? Even something as simple as the Notes app that comes with the phone has never done that - once you type it it’s there regardless of when or how quick you close the app. So right there I just didn’t like the experience and am going to look for another app. Completely throws off the experience and now you can’t even trust the app to do the most basic of things - save what you wrote."

I really love the app, however the new UI change is confusing and generally bad — I really enjoyed the old tab where you could see the daily streaks plus the color coded bars helped me know which journal I was in. Also, I have to click in twice to see the “on this day tab” when I’d much prefer it to be fixed above my entries. 

Like many other reviewers mentioned, the book tab seems slightly redundant. I hope the developers will take this feedback in mind. I initially was not going to write in a review, but after seeing others share similar sentiments, I think Dayone should reconsider their layout."

Overall I have enjoyed using the app, but I’m always looking for something better. Wish the original developers could come back. Oh well, that’s progress.

Update 6/5/24

I’ve used the app extensively for the past day.  It had my vote for the “Ugliest App in the App Store 2024”, if that is an anti-reward category.   The developers really love shades of gray and off-whites.  I’m convinced the developers are color blind, so probably I should apologize to them."

Unforgivnn,11345024270,2024-06-04T23:11:58-07:00,2,"Hello-

Been using Day One Premium for years as a very satisfied (paying) customer.

That said, I have to echo many others. The new UI is absolutely awful. The new “book” view requires extra clicks to get to stats that used to be at the top of the list view. It is a waste of space and is completely unnecessary.

There was no problem with the previous UI and this feels like change for the sake of change to try to give the perception of “staying fresh”. As a software developer myself, this is one of the worst things I see other developers do.

After years of paying for Day One, I genuinely find myself considering finding an alternative. Rather than responding with “we are here to help you through the changes”, PLEASE listen to your customers and bring back the previous UI. I don’t need your “help”. I have figured out how to use the new UI and have quickly concluded that I hate it."

I have to close the app entirely and reopen and keep the app in portrait only to prevent crashing during note taking.

Overall despite this love the app and have for many years. I assume the problem will eventually be resolved but will give a one star to draw attention to issue."

Now it’s cramped up to the top and much less informative at a glance. I liked being able to see the numbers, like where my streak is at, without having to tap to open another menu, and it was much more visually appealing when there was some room to breathe at the top.

I also really miss the color bar at the top of each journal entry, so that you could see the journal in which you were writing. Now all individual entries look the same, regardless of which journal you are using so easy to mistake one journal for another. Can you please bring back the style, prior to the update, and can you please give us a prettier color to highlight with, such as a light yellow, green, pink, or blue, instead of mustard yellow?"

Kevin 72638393,11340246942,2024-06-03T15:16:38-07:00,1,"May 2024 UPDATE: They decided to totally change the UI. Yet again. It looks nothing like the award winning app of old, and they’re removing functionality (like you can’t see your sync status on the home screen anymore - arguably one of the most important functions of the app). The decline continues. I’m preparing to go to another journal service soon. I had high hopes but it’s clear Automatic is drastically changing things. This isn’t the Day One we all knew and loved. ANOTHER UPDATE: April 2024. Syncing is now a disaster. I’ve been down on multiple devices and despite half a dozen emails and tons of log files, support has no idea. What happened to you, Day One ?!?! Curse you, Automatic Inc, for the decline of what was once a shining example of a customer focused app with rock solid support. You are hastening people’s move off the platform. I WANT to use the app but every month there’s a new issue. Bugs are popping up all over. UPDATED AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE, 8/16/23: Nope, they're actually wrong. I'm a developer myself - you have a bug in your app. The exact commands referenced puts you in the same looped workflow of documentation and never opens the email client. And the revamped timeline still looks awful. I'm looking at alternative journal solutions - like Apple Journal or Bear Notes. Day One has gone backwards. UPDATED 8/1/23: They are making changes, and not for the better. Dropped from 3 stars to 2. They totally borked the time line view now - increasing the front size and adding useless data, so now you can only see like 3-4 entries at a time with lots of wasted space. Journal apps don't need constant UI changes. In fact - it's a problem. Journaling is a routine oriented task - and millions have adopted the Day One workflow. Changing it for no tangible benefit is crazy, and has me looking at Bear Notes and other alternatives. Who is driving these feature changes over there? It's getting worse... Oh - and despite being a premium user - you actually cannot contact support anymore! Their own documentation directs you to an area of the app that seems changed - it just redirects to old, outdated documentation instead of directing to an email message client. Yikes. If you are considering Day One as a newbie, consider something else. This app is not the clear winner it used to be. Fixes no one asked for, while user-favorite features (cough cough web app) are in perpetual Beta. OLD Review: The iOS app is great, but the application itself is severely lacking due to the recent, quiet, abandonment of their web browser app. They were working on it, and there was a highly anticipated beta - but it’s been shutdown and abandoned (they say temporarily, but it doesn’t look like it - they wouldn’t shut access down entirely if really temporary). There is currently no way to access any part of your journal on a windows desktop browser. So - the app is good, but it’s tedious in daily life as you can’t easily get items from your desktop into your journal."

It’s led to a frustrating journaling experience that is supposed to be an enjoyable and calming part of my day. I reached out to support and got an AI chat bot response.

I’d like to see the Underline come back.

The book mark is great, and the ability to word search is very good, but I’d like the ability to narrow down the word/quote search in a more refined way.

Kleis Sarah,11265989876,2024-05-14T03:52:24-07:00,5,"I have used and changed so many time in a year when it comes to journaling and documenting my concerns and fears. I believe that there is a lot of areas that can be addressed when journaling and so far, Day One has nailed all areas. It is an amazing program and though it has only been 5 days. I do feel as though this will be something I stick with. I typically use journaling to get through issues or concerns, and sometimes huge emotional challenges. Once I write them out I tend to stop journaling, but with Day On, I feel that the templates for added discussions as well as the daily question or prompt, will help me stay a head of the emotional black hole I end up in."
Gomzy12,11263615948,2024-05-13T10:05:06-07:00,5,"Dayone is a great option for a reliable private diary with ease of jotting down your thoughts or ideas and ease of info look up. Love that it has iPhone shortcuts to directly record audio and transcribe in one click. SMS into journal is also a good idea. 

Would love to see transcribe option or audio to text from Apple Watch rather than just have audio recording option from Apple Watch. Day one has great photo and video storage option but can’t be a replacement for Google photos yet. I would love to see advancements where I could ditch Google photos for Dayone. I know I am trying to have all in one but if this could have OCR from images and handwriting search then nothing can beat it. Hope to see at least some of the suggestions implemented."

Mah Jongg Mommy,11249543596,2024-05-09T11:16:15-07:00,4,"This app is fantastic! I use it for quite a few things. 
I use it for regular journal.
I have 17 chronic diseases and I use it as a daily symptom tracker. 
**Here’s where the app could improve: I have created a few symbols which I saved to my photo library. Example, one is a bright lightening bolt for bad neuropathy days. Unfortunately, because I have already used this photograph on the day it was created, DAY ONE won’t permit me to use it multiple times so I can see it as the main image on the calendar. 
I want to see these symbols I have created so when I visit with one of my physicians, I am able to pull up the calendar to see how often I was having symptoms for a particular disease. 
Perhaps Day One could create actual symbols / sticker / feelings face, to add to actual calendar… for example if I was glancing at the month, even though there is a photograph of my dog, I could add a symbol to acknowledge something medical related. 
A ""+"" symbol on each day of the calendar would allow a person to add a necessary symbol (pretty much almost any emoji that is currently available on the keyboard would suffice). 
Users need a way to put something visible on the view of the monthly calendar so they can refer back to a specific day and not have to search through every entry to find what they were looking at. 
One symbol I made is ""HEALTH UPDATE"" it’s purple and turquoise. It takes the place of a personal photograph. However, because I created it January 3, 2024… Day One says I already used that photograph and I am not able to override it and use it again and again anytime I choose. 
*App should permit people to freely use the same photo as often as they choose… it’s their choice!
Otherwise… love the app!"

I have tried to send feedback but I am directed to a forum where I apparently have to have a “domain” and pay a fee in order to ask a question! Twice now, I’ve had issues where entries have not synced properly from my iPhone to my iPad. Only part of the entry transfers over. I get a message saying “there is a later version” but this so-called later version is actually the partial entry. The later part completely disappears, it’s not even visible in the cloud. So I have several paragraphs that no longer exist. I do not appreciate losing my writing, especially when I can’t get a message to the company about what is happening.

UPDATE: Developer, could you please explain to me when I try to access your forum, I am being directed to a site to create a “domain”? Why is that even necessary? The only way I can communicate with you is through this review."

Whatever you want to call it. We who bought your app from the early days. The ones who bought it SEPARATELY FOR ALL iOS iPad AND MACOS devices can now move along. Nothing to see here. Just call it whatever you want but no way is a subscription model worth anything when Apple has a perfectly great substitute NON SUBSCRIPTION ALTERNATIVE in the app store. You guys are all the same. Stop updating apps for those who were with you from the jump. Who overpaid from the jump because we believed in you. Wanted you to grow and succeed. Now its all cherry eyed happiness oh sorry no more updates we don’t need or want your support anymore. Just like Notability and all the rest. Good riddance.

I was looking for an app that would help me document my journey into the crafting world - saving photos, learning techniques etc.  but I soon was using it for documenting nearly everything in my life.  From being able to have multiple journals, to tags, and the ability to access my journals on all the platforms I use (iOS, Mac, Windows) - this app hits every checkmark for what I wanted in a journal, and more!  

I recently had to contact support for help with an issue, and immediately got a response (AI assistant), and when my issue was more complicated (so I thought), got an immediate response from one of their ""Happiness Engineers"".  That made me smile twice: first on reading it, and second because the help I got really made me happy!  (As it turned out - it wasn't anything with DayOne app, it was user error, but the Support folks were amazing in helping me understand what happened!)

From the way I plan my day. To the way I have learned to navigate my thoughts with more precision. It’s a must have. From the customization by colors of journals. To the sharing across devices. DayOne has effortlessly reawakened my love for writing. It’s a 5 star app. From a free user. I would love to see what a paid subscription could bring. I test the Beta and it’s def worth the money.

If you are more seasoned and/or you know how and what you want to write about each day, you can easily build a custom template and begin with the same template each day.  
I love being able to add pictures to the journal as well.  There are several ways you can use this, but I prefer to add any pictures from the to day to my daily journal entry.  Some of the other features include being able to add or include other types of media to your entry.  Although I personally do not use this feature, it is cool to know its there.

FranimalP,11115637888,2024-04-02T21:26:28-07:00,5,I highly recommend Day One. I have been using it for over a decade and think it’s the best on the market. In fact I live in fear it might someday go away! I have prints books from my journals and they come out beautifully and high quality. Treasured items in our home.
HLCnAZ,11115511560,2024-04-02T20:27:09-07:00,1,"The help feature on this app is absolutely horrible! I used to love this app. I used it every single solitary day for almost a year and now I can’t log back in. I am in just the death cycle of trying and trying and trying and not getting the email sent to me for the password reset. I am really concerned because I have over 200 or more journal entries and I can’t access them or create new journal entries. I used to use the text feature to add a journal entry and it was so easy but now I can’t login. I don’t know if it’s because I got a new phone or what. But as I said, at the beginning, the help feature on this app is absolutely horrible. THEN THEY TRY TO PATHETICALLY answer / of COURSE I have an email with the login and there’s ZERO WAYS to actually get help. There’s no way to get to an actual person.

And now I get a THIRD response and STILL NO ONE ANSWERS!! I have been in the same death loop of help. I get no email yet that’s the email I’m using."
chachacha2014,11113987374,2024-04-02T10:14:06-07:00,1,"I purchased the Day One Premium on January 7, 2024, through the Apple Store along with another app called ‘Me+’. The total was $59.52 ($34.99 for Day One with a promotion, $19.99 for Me+, plus tax). I attempted to cancel and get a refund for ‘Me+’, but since it was purchased together with Day One, I couldn’t receive a partial refund. I got fully refunded $59.52 on January 18.

However, I recently discovered that I was rebilled by Apple on January 29, but I cannot access the Premium since it shows as cancelled. I can provide my bank transactions and the receipt from Apple.

Please help! I’ve tried reaching out to customer service, but there’s been no response. I haven’t been able to use the Premium features for the past three months. Can you please check?

I love this app. I will fix my rate once my concern is resolved."

48th Parallel,11109778640,2024-04-01T07:19:30-07:00,5,"I don’t know that this review is worth much as I have never used any other digital journal but for my many purposes, Day One is perfect.  I liked it so much I purchased another subscription for my spouse but she still prefers a paper journal with her fountain pen.  And here’s where the huge differences between the two forms really shows up.  When she wants to find the date when something happened, it’s a laborious search.  I just type the event or name or place into the search feature and I get all the hits, the most recent entry first.  With Day One I can add photos, video links, emails, texts, or even parts of daily newsletters I get as instantly as a 72 year old man can do anything instantly.  I have separate journals for books bought, borrowed, and read, for projects I’m working on, and for travelogues.  For my spouse to do any of those things is nye impossible in a paper journal just from a space standpoint.  And if I too want the feel and flow of ink on paper, which I often do, I do just that and take a photo to enter on my digital journal.
	But it’s when you’ve been at Day One for awhile that some of it’s marvelous features begin to show up.  The “On This Day” feature is a treat.  For instance, today it shows that I have four entries for today.  To click on that and discover anew what I was doing three, four, five years ago today is, in addition to being fun and informative, a daily jolt regarding the passage of time.
	Two other features I love about Day One is that it syncs my journal across all my devices.  I can jot down an entry on my phone when I’m waiting in line at the car wash or having lunch in a diner.  I can check on an entry from last year when I’m on the go.  The other thing I prize is the privacy.  My Day One is password protected which allows me to be a little more free with personal details than I otherwise would be.
	Does Day One have some warts.  I’ve yet to meet an app that doesn’t but, again, for my needs this things I would like different are so few that I haven’t even bothered mentioning them to management.  I hope I’ve made it clear why I think this app deserves five stars."
lmatt12,11104518769,2024-03-30T19:59:31-07:00,5,Love this journal and look at it everyday.  I’ve been writing in it for 12 years now. I go look at what I was doing this day for the last 12 years. I don’t even remember some of the thing I wrote and I’m so glad for each and every memory. Thanks Day One for a quality product.
Sheila Burns,11103173456,2024-03-30T10:59:41-07:00,5,"One of the features I love, having used Day One for several years, is that it lets me know I have previous entries from same date in years past and of  gives me access to read entries from same dates in years past. 
 Day One also has a search feature that easily helps me to find topics that I wrote about last week or last year."
Macorin,11099772681,2024-03-29T13:03:54-07:00,2,"I bought Day One for iOS and OSX but didn’t feel the need to purchase a subscription. I would have if it offered features I couldn’t live without, but it doesn’t, so why spend the money unnecessarily? I’ve rated this app two stars because the journal is good, even if buggy at times. I couldn’t go more than two stars because I don’t think it’s right that they reserve live support for subscriptions only. I paid money for your apps and should be able to get support when needed. I can see giving subscription members priority support and making others wait longer, but to not offer live support to those that have supported and purchased your products before subscriptions were even a thing is just wrong. If a subscription offered me something I needed, I’d buy it, but I don’t need to add more than ten photos or videos to my entries. And I certainly won’t pay just to get support. In fact, that alone is reason enough to never buy the subscription. You might as well call your subscription a support plan, not a subscription."

I first got so annoyed that I started to reverse my order of journal entries so that the first thing I could do when I opened Word was write my newest journal entry! It eventually got so messy and long though, so then I thought, “there’s GOT to be something else out there!!! This is the 21st century for Christ’s sake!!!” Then, I opened the App Store and found Day One, and my life was literally changed forever, and I could not be more thankful for this app!!! ?????? I’m currently using Day One’s free premium trial, and it’s so great that I wish so so badly I could make my own money bc if I did, I would TOTALLY pay for a subscription immediately!!! Too bad I only have so long until my trial ends... ??"

I was so excited to use the new and improved version; however, it is constantly (and by constantly, I mean with each and every use) crashing. No matter what I try to do (write a new entry, look at historical entries etc) or where I try to do it (iPhone vs iPad), the app freezes, and the only way to fix the issue is to close the app and go back in. Further, even when I am typing on the new app, there is a big lag in the words. Please please please fix this. This app would be perfect if only it didn't freeze all the time!"

Yogiini Carolyn,11085342173,2024-03-25T14:29:26-07:00,5,"I keep about 12 sub journals concurrently with salient topics.  It has become a lifesaver for me as well as an easy way to check on a particular subject.

When I suffered with serious digestive issues, I started one titled Gastrointestinal.  Appointments with my gastroenterologist were very disappointing because he would say, “No coffee.”  Then when I read his notes concerning our office visits he would reiterate that the colonoscopies were unremarkable but I was described as labile.
     That really made me angry.  Of course I’m labile, if you were going through what I’m dealing with you would be labile, too!   I was actually contemplating how I could leave this plant without it looking like suicide.  It was that bad. 
     I thought, “OK, Buddy, you are about to get some journal entries.”  I copied about four horrendous days of entries and gave them to the receptionist for him to read before my next appointment.  They became part of my health record so they couldn’t be ignored.  
    Outcome:  he ordered an upper GI, lower GI and stool sample.  At last I was heard.  Result:  no pancreatic digestive enzymes and I needed supplementation.  I was normal at last after years of agony.
     If you have a chronic condition and are being gaslighted, I urge you to keep a journal on the symptoms and and how they are impacting your life.  Tell your story and be honest and graphic.  Dates and times and related events are important and helpful for diagnosis."

cpoetree,11081634725,2024-03-24T13:44:56-07:00,5,"Day One provides space and encouragement for more than a memoir, a diary or a daily journal.

With a provocative prompt for each day and the possibility to include images, it offers space for musing and personalizing life as we live it.

It is beautifully formatted, allowing search, dating and recall to happen easily.  Also, when one runs into a snag (and I have) help is readily available.  I have found it to be clear and effective.

If I could afford it, I would readily choose to update my Day One to premium.  Although I cannot, using Day One on a primary level is a delight this daily user would not miss.

Day One helps me grow!  Thank you to those who created it, maintain it and update it!  I'm beyond grateful."

With that, I purchased the premium, and since have experienced numerous quirks which have caused me to alter my opinion.

Far too frequently I have received “are you happy with your experience?” pop ups as I’m trying to utilize the app which appear in inconvenient locations (like over something I’m reading or trying to write)..and if that was annoying enough,..they have seldom worked, or went away, literally blocking my screen!!

Other times,..things I’ve clicked on direct to other places on the app I was not intending to see!

I would not be concerned about any of this had I not paid!

So unless they correct these bugs soon, I’ll be cancelling my subscription and would greatly warn anyone from paying for the premium package."

I tell people about it all the time because I have nothing but good things to say. There are so many features that I love about it! Just so incredibly well designed. I saw that Apple came out with a Journaling app but it doesn’t even come close to how perfectly developed this app is. 10 stars for me.

I try and I try but never manage to make it longer than a few weeks before I’ve given up on writing. Day One was recommended by a guest on The Tim Ferriss Show, so I decided to check it out. I’ve never loved something so much in my life. Writing has become part of my daily routine. The journal categories allow you to compartmentalize so many things and the fact that you can make notes on your phone to deep dive into later on the PC is just phenomenal. I can take create an entry while walking at the park and make quick notes of a podcast I’m listening to, then recall and complete the whole idea when I get home. If thoughts start creeping in while laying bed and I’m having difficulty falling asleep, again I can make a quick entry to dump the idea from my brain, and sleep comfortably knowing I can address the next morning on the pc. There’s just so much utility with this app. I love it. If I ever become a famous writer, this will be mentioned as one of my favorite and most valuable purchases of all time."

Don’t use many of the very advanced features, because it’s main function as a journal works so well. Records where you were, the weather and so much more automatically. I keep one journal for each car, and a Journal of “things” where I photo any warrenty item with the receipt. Has come in very handy!

Here are the things I really like about Day One -

— can use across all my devices with ease
— I am able to copy, forward and even create PDFs of my entries when needed - this was a big let down with the apple journal app… I started using that until I realized that you cannot copy or export anything once it is in their app. 
— picture tagging - love that the app automatically goes to the pictures with the same date(s) as the journal entry.  Makes it so simple.
— hashtag capability - makes this easy to organize my journal in a way my mind works
—automatically imports instagram posts (now, we just need it to do the same for facebook - that’s where I posted a lot of my stuff before) 

Enhancements I would like to see:
—facebook post integration
—bible app integration would be AMAZING"

However last week I was scammed and lost access to my Apple ID. The scammers locked me out of it. I had to get a new id. I wrote to the support email explaining the situation and got back a template email with links to their FAQs- and said they only give individual support to those who pay. You call that good customer service? I don’t. I won’t be using their app again. I heard from the developer but I am still not satisfied. In fact, I am very angry. Any link you provide to offer help is a link to the help page. Option 1 is the Help guides which are links to articles and tutorials. Option 2 is the DayOne forum, but In order to write to the forum you must have an account on Wordpress-something I don’t care to have- even if the first year is free. The only other option on the page is for premium users, of which I was one but cannot use it because I lost the use of my AppleID. As I said above, I won’t be back.

uttufxuxu,11013209719,2024-03-05T19:58:38-07:00,5,"Day one is the best journal app because you can add photos write about your day and after a year or so you can see your memories and you’ll never forget them. It has an option if you want notifications or not and doesn’t just automatically send them to you. I can unwind my day before I go to sleep and it’s the best way to do that! It also improves your typing and grammar but you don’t even work at it, you just get on the habit over time. Overall you should get this app because it’s a helpful app that gets me to sleep every night and brings myself up looking at the good parts of my day."

LDesiena,11011471875,2024-03-05T08:48:21-07:00,4,The only downside of the app is the less than good Apple Pencil for writing for the day. You have to do by drawing. Could be better. I have used the app for years. Overall a good app.

Switching to Diarium from here on out - it has just about everything Day One has, doesn’t require a subscription (only a one time fee for the same features Day One subscription-walls), plus it’s not run by people who gladly house transphobes and other bigots on their social media platforms."

I loved being able to journal whatever I want. However, I quickly realized it was lacking features such as the ability to back up entries outside of the app. I discovered Day One as an alternative. The app does every thing I need and more. I do think that there is some features that could be added on for quality of life. I hope the app keeps improving."

The thing that I like most about this journal is that I have been used to using a five-year journal where I could see every year previous. I couldn’t find an online one that did this. This journal does! It shows you a year in review. I haven’t made it yet, but I’m happy to know that it’ll show me what I’ve done in previous years on the same day. A great journal! So easy to use."
houstonbruce,10952701238,2024-02-18T06:20:18-07:00,5,"UPDATE: February 2024
I really enjoy Day One. They make it convenient to journal. I also have a text reminder that reminds me, daily, to write. It is so convenient to do this, and often, I copy and paste messages I have written others, into my journaling process. Why write things twice.

One feature I want to explore more of is family journaling, but I am not sure my family would want to do this. 

Templates make things easier if you have repetitive forms of journaling in mind. 

UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2023 I do not really have any complaints with this app. It does what it says, and I feel that my data and personal information is reasonably-secure. I like being able to text my entries. Helpful if I have already written something I want to document that I have written to family or friends via text message. That was a feature I really liked—the ability the app had to ask if I wanted to open the application after using iOS Share Sheet to post a journal entry. If it went away, please bring it back. It is super-helpful to have the option to click and just go directly into the app."

It gives me a chance to reflect on each day and reminds me of the good things and experiences in my life.  The ability to add photos and memories is fantastic.
As I said it’s been 80 days since I started journaling and look forward to years as this is a great way to diary and reflect on your life experiences."
McCarthyAero,10948782130,2024-02-17T05:49:27-07:00,3,"I like the format for the most part. For some reason - perhaps a bug - entry’s will not record. The process goes like this. Hit the “plus” to begin the entry, type, perhaps a few photos. Hit “done” - poof! Gone. The entry is not saved. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. Frustrating."
OnHD,10938132431,2024-02-14T07:11:49-07:00,1,"I’m a PLUS legacy user. I find their weather service is in accurate and I don’t want my historical journal entries to be incorrect. That seems incompatible with why one journals to begin with. I’ve asked Support if I can disable the weather service entirely. However they declined to answer my question because I’m not a premium user I paid money for the version of the app that I use, and as a paying customer I expect some level of support at least for simple questions. I’m not pleased that this developer has chosen to ignore needs of non-premium paid users. I found you could ask this question of their automated online chat bot, and you get an answer, it’s just an answer that is not true, and it directs you to take steps with features that don’t exist.
2/14/24 Update: I did receive a developer response in informing me that my Plus plan was discontinued nine years ago. I’m well aware of that. My point was, while the plan may have been discontinued, I still purchased the app and the developer has my money. It’s my feeling that there should be some “support” quid pro quo connected to that fact, otherwise the developer has simply stiffed a paid customer. Don’t get me wrong, I still love the app and will continue to use it, as it far surpasses anything it’s competitors offer. I just feel cheated on the Support issue, and I think others should be aware of that."

macbookpro15,10934348008,2024-02-13T06:17:26-07:00,2,So I’ve used day one for the last 2 years and I have had a premium membership with them. Unfortunately the app quality has gone down over time with the app having a lot of bugs. This I understand to some extent however their support is very bad too. The turn around time for answers is over a week I have had several tickets with them and the answering took forever and at the end of the day their support engineers are just not equipped to do proper support. I literally figured out two issues on my own when their support was unable to help me one was with ordering a book and the other one was with the payment failing. In both cases doing a clean install and losing all the books I prepared fixed the issue. I think if they want to be around for a longer period of time they need to step up their game and go back to how they used to be.

Can’t say enough good things about it, but I do have one issue I would like you to address and that is could you make the scrubber bar on the iPhone etc I noticed it’s white. Could you make it a color so it stands out more. I missed it for the longest time before I realized it was even there. Just saying. It’s great when you scrub and the date appears next to it that makes it supper easy to find a particular date. Thats really smart. Thanks for an exceptional app

Oh yea almost forgot…Is there anyway you could do the find function so it’s highlighted? Whenever you do a find for something you need to look through the whole entire entry to see where it’s at as it’s never highlighted in yellow etc like most apps do. Is that a possibility to change that? I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for your great work."
Geekgirl1971,10907585644,2024-02-06T00:20:19-07:00,3,I’m very disappointed and upset with this app. I recorded my first audio recording last night. Then I went through the written dictation and corrected the grammar issues and mistakes it made with what I said. A process that took me 20-30 mins to fix. I hit done and it appeared to save. A few moments later I realized my entire entry just vanished. I’ve looked everywhere on my account and found nothing. What is the point of using this app if it doesn’t store my recordings. And how do I get to the cloud part of the app that’s showing at the top of the page? I sent a message through the contact us area but no one has bothered to respond. I’m not going to pay for an app that wastes my time and efforts.

Every morning after I do my daily devotional I do my entry from what I did the day before. Having the pictures to look back on is priceless.

I stated that another good friend has kept a journal since he was a boy. She told me… “It’s never too late to start!”

I started this journal that day, as a way of logging information for my grandchildren when they are older.  

Over the last 900 plus days, I’ve expanded how I use it to log a record of health related items.  I keep adding other things too.  Any time I have something that I think could be noteworthy, I log it.  For example something that might be useful in documentation of a legal matter or whatever.  

Lastly I make sure to log every day.  In addition to keeping track of my weight and exercise I’ve done, I’ve set a goal to actually do something during the day that is noteworthy.   Another way to say that is to make sure I don’t have to disappoint myself by stating that I didn’t do anything today!"

I keep a regular photo journal here where I put time stamped curated photos, and this can be done at the end of each day, or a month later when you have some free time or are home sick or whatever. I also use this to jot down some story about an event or day f I want.

On any given day, I will snap a few pictures of something that brings me joy to include in this journal. I don't need to worry if the photo is 'good' or if anyone else will like it. It is just for me!  When I go back through my phone camera roll, most days have something, and there are fond memories!

This is also great for journalling trips, etc. 

I also keep a private journal (both are private, but this one double-checks before showing any previews on my screen), and this is where I vent, complain, record frustrating experiences, etc. It is so much easier to move on from something if you have documented how it made you feel. This journal helps me move past this, but also allows me to go back and process as needed, and can be a helpful reference for therapy sessions. 

Oh, there is also a email option where I can type an entry into an email that will send directly into my journal. I use this for longer entries. 

I really like having a separate app for all of this to avoid feeling like it might be a Google or Apple product that I might feel stuck with later."

I use it for a day to day list  at the end of my day to remember daily events.  I use it for different workshops and classes I attend.  For poetry writing.  For a prayer journal.  I love the search feature.  I used to keep handwritten journals but then lost track of things I had written.  I do wish there was an easier way to transfer a document into a word document.  Other than that I highly recommend this journal.

I don’t have social media, so it’s always nice to see the memories pop up on here. I recently tried out other journal apps to see if they could be a replacement, but none of them work for me."

It is very bland.  Boring.  Would like to see ways to change the look of the calendar, add stickers of some kind, etc.. Anything to make this app a little more exciting. I’m going to try it out as is and see what I think after the free trial."

I’ve lost interest in the public aspect and paper journals are almost more than I want to do on a daily basis. I found Day One through the Wonder Tools newsletter and decided to try it out. 

It’s packed with features. Even if you don’t know what to write, there are handy templates and prompts to help you develop a writing habit. For me, it’s therapeutic and helps me work out things in my life through thought and documentation. 

I really can’t recommend it enough."

However, I cannot understand how they expect people to type a 1-2 page journal every day on their phone. This doesn’t make sense at all. Yes, the app is nice with lots of features, but there has to be a PC version, or at least a web version that does’t look like an 8 grader designed and developed it. Especially when Day One is the most expensive journal “solution” out there. Honestly, I have no idea why people give this a 5 star, but I bet my life they are all Mac users. Deleted."

Staring at an empty page and feeling the need to write something profound. Or journal prompts I found didn’t really resonate or inspire me. I recently found Day One and I’m addicted! It’s only day 6 and I already have 17 entries. The prompts allow me to explore and be curious. Even though I’ve reused journal prompts on different days, it’s never boring. Each day brings new opportunities and obstacles and so the prompts feel brand new. I cannot tell you how much this app has helped with my mental health and overall happiness. This is literally the second review I’ve ever written but I had to because it was so important to me. Download it!! You won’t regret it."

I tried fixing it by turning off the iPhone and even deleted and reinstalled the app a couple of times but that didn't work, then. 

I next contacted the apps help line and got a message back that my problem would be passed on to their tech people.

Today I tried again to make a new entry on the iPhone app and it still froze so then I tried deleting the app and afterwards turning off my iPhone for five minutes.

When I reinstalled Day One app on my iPhone and waited till after it synced with icloud downloading all my past entries I again tried to make a new entry and this time it worked!

I  guess that the apps tech must have been working on it so my deleting the app and reinstalling it this time worked,  so if you have the same problem try it!

I often dictate voice to text. I really like the ability to have multiple journals for different purposes. Does everything I need it to, and I feel a huge relief that I’m finally capturing the important details of life again.

UsefulReviewsNow,10764437988,2023-12-30T15:00:30-07:00,4,"The journaling concept is amazing. It meets all my needs and is by far the best free app of its kind. Unfortunately, there are a lot of drawbacks if you don’t choose the premium plan, which is roughly $36/year. For instance, if you don’t want to splurge on premium, you can not add videos or multiple photos into one entry. It is to be noted that you can add one photo per entry without premium. Also, there is no cross-device sharing without premium. You can’t start on your phone and end on your Mac unless you pay the price.

Overall, these don’t detract from an otherwise enjoyable journaling experience, but without premium, the line is thin between Day One and the standard Apple Notes app."

DayOne is integrated across the iOS platform, so you can quickly send photos, articles, or inspiration from around the internet to your journal. The tagging and searching are top notch. You can even create separate journals for different projects or themes.

One of the best features is the location, weather, and activity logging that seamlessly integrate into new entries. When I’m out and about, I take a lot of pictures, but don’t always add them to DayOne the same day. When I create a new entry, I can add the photos and am immediately prompted to apply the photo date and location, so it keeps everything in order.

I love how the developer keeps making DayOne better. I know Apple has launched their own journalling app, but I’m committed to this wonderful app that has stood the test of time and is now a daily feature in my life."

I hope it remains just the way it is, for many years into the future.  One improvement I wouldn’t mind would be if the voice to text was a little more accurate sometimes.  It gets about 90% of the words right, and I can usually make the corrections pretty quickly.  I wish every app I use was this dependable, versatile, and useful."

I love writing, but I have always struggled with sitting down to write and getting overwhelmed while staring at a blank page. This app has a dictation feature which allows me to speak freely while the app transcribes it in real time. You can then go back and edit later. This is incredibly useful to me in the mornings, when most of my ideas hit me, but I have very little time to write them down because I’m getting ready for work. This app allows you to record and leave it running so you can simply talk at your device when you have something that you want to write down. There are many incredibly useful features in here, but the transcription is the one that wins the day for me. I highly recommend giving this app a try if you are a writer at heart, but struggle either with time or feeling overwhelmed in figuring out where to start."

But other than that everything is free. There are many templates you can choose from! You can choose from a To-Do-List from a goal planner, self reflection journal, to a meal prep, etc. The options are endless. 

I recommend you try this app. I promise you won’t regret it :)"

Its user experience is unmatched, providing a seamless and visually appealing interface. The GUI is simply beautiful, making the act of journaling a delightful experience. One standout feature is the effortless insertion of media from the current date, allowing me to easily enhance my memories. Additionally, Day One offers simple markdown support, enabling me to format my entries exactly how I want them. 
The inclusion of daily prompts adds a creative touch, sparking inspiration for my journaling journey. I particularly appreciate the ""On this day"" pop-ups that remind me of my thoughts and experiences from a year ago, giving me a chance to reflect and appreciate my own growth. Furthermore, Day One rewards users for creating streaks, encouraging consistency in journaling. Overall, Day One surpasses all other journaling apps with its unmatched user experience and  features."

Its developers never listened to users and called us “vocal minority” when we asked for something THEY did not like. Removed all the great features from the app, photo stream was great once, now it’s no different from regular photo app, limited many features under subscription. Broke the book printing (our family bought a plan and tried 5 times to print the book - never worked, support couldn’t help). So it brings us to the present day with an app crippled by its own creator. Well, classic human story with its roots in the ancient scriptures."

A password recovery email was sent, I followed the link, and it would open up a Chrome tab directly to my account.

Which means that someone would merely need to have my email and request an account recovery and have direct access to my day one account on Chrome.

As an extension, the password recovery would do as I have outlined above and to change my password I wouldn’t have to reenter the password that I forgot.

Lastly, when I go to speak with customer support or “contact customer support I don’t actually get to contact anybody. I am directed to the FAQs or their forum, which to post, and I need to sign in."

I tried the recent apple journal, but at this time, there’s no comparison. I suspect though, apple might iterate to the point where dayone might start need to worry, even the paid version of dayone.

Now they just made the previous app unusable and replaced it with this new one so that they could get more money. Original app you paid once and you were done. Now they try to make you pay a monthly fee for “premium” to get basically the same thing as what I already owned. They don’t even offer like a curtesy credit for the users who had paid for the previous app. They didn’t do any of this to benefit the consumer. They did it to get more money. Why would I pay for a monthly subscription to write like I can on the built in iPhone notes app?! Ridiculous

iOS notes
Notebooks by Afons Schmid

I’ve whittled it down to two : 
 iOS Notes and Day One.

I’ve been using iOS notes for 15 years. I have used Day One in the past. But wasn’t satisfied with it. Then they did a super upgrade to it and it appears as though it’s a strong contender for the best Notes app. I’ve compared iOS notes with Day One feature by feature, capability by capability. So far Day One is  in the lead. But it’s close. I’ll post again when I’ve decided."

La Nikacia,10680633807,2023-12-10T19:21:51-07:00,1,"I got to the registration page and had the option of signing up with my Apple face recognition or email and password. My short term memory has been failing due to health issues which is why I wanted the app in the first place. 

Knowing that I’d inevitably randomly get signed out and get flustered and upset having to reset a password I wouldn’t remember, I chose to sign in with Apple. The app read my face and accepted it. Then…nothing. I could never get past that page even after the face scan recognized me every time. 

If just accessing the app doesn’t work correctly, how annoying is using it going to be? Deleting it right away. Disappointed, it looked fun and helpful."
SpiderKisses21,10674383659,2023-12-09T05:34:55-07:00,5,I would highly recommend this journal. You can have as many little journals as you want.

My phone is always nearby and usually in my hands.  It is so easy to jot down some thoughts and feelings whenever they arise. 

I looked at several apps and deleted all except this one.  I use it on the simplest level.   It has tons of features, but they are not intrusive.  Just there if I want them.

Lalit Mishra,10651625209,2023-12-02T20:41:29-07:00,5,"Day One Journal App stands out as a premier digital journaling platform, providing a seamless and enriched experience for capturing life's moments. Its interface is elegantly simple, inviting users to document their thoughts and activities without the distraction of cluttered toolbars.

One of Day One's most compelling features is its versatility. Whether you're a minimalist who appreciates the one-click entry system and clean design or a detail-oriented person who enjoys cataloging entries with metadata like location, weather, and music, Day One caters to all. The app's use of templates and prompts ingeniously lowers the barrier to journaling, making it accessible even when inspiration is scarce.

For those who like to journal on-the-go, Day One's multimedia capabilities allow for a rich recording of experiences, enabling users to add photos, videos, and even audio to their entries. The app also respects the private nature of journaling, offering robust security features to protect personal musings.

Customizable reminders are another innovative aspect, helping users build a consistent journaling habit by setting multiple prompts throughout the day, tailored to their schedule.

In essence, Day One excels not just as a digital journal but as a companion for life's journey, providing a versatile, secure, and user-friendly space to document personal growth, reflect on experiences, and store memories."

Making a habit of using Day One has saved me time, lowered my anxiety, and saved me money. 
It’s worth the subscription. Get it. 

The longer version that ADHDers in particular will see themselves in and understand:

Losing time finding things, buying things you think will fix you but you never use, buying another of the thing you can’t find or forgot you already have, is the “ADHD Tax.” I’ve paid. 
(I personally consider losing writing, ideas, and pictures part of the ADHD tax.)  

Day One  is the first app (or physical book) I’ve ever used regularly. I did have to build the habit, but it wasn’t hard because Day One is effortless. 

I have many lovely journals. a couple bujos, planners, and the guilt from not using them. 
I used to have a lot of stuff “somewhere” and had to go on a safari every time I needed any of it. 

I use Day One for journaling, saving ideas for projects, corralling spicy social media drafts and angry emails safely away from that “send” button, cataloging stuff in bins, boxes, and baskets, venting, pet pictures, and checklisting.  
It’s a boss feeling when you think, “Where is the (insert thing  here)?” and I can look it up, see it’s in Bin 3, grab it, and get back to what I was doing. 
Day One has tagging so it’s even easier to find that #blue faux fur or tell yourself #Go Me. 

My one and only beef  is that Day One is a subscription instead of a purchase. I’d love a version I could buy and set to back up to Dropbox or my personal cloud storage. 
On the other hand, this year’s cost of using Day One is definitely less than an unused planner and replacing a jacket."

I'd be much more consistent in journaling if I was just able to access it through the internet with a desktop.

But a couple weeks ago I noticed a button inviting me to turn on  automatic sync. Well. BEWARE. When I did that, my journal of many years, all the entries and the journal itself, GONE. 
I have read the blogs and sleuthed to find an old backup in Time Machine, and that got me everything except this year and I just lost my father and had journaled that journey. Gone. I’ve tried contacting 3 times now and no one answers their email. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this company."

I love how I can make unlimited  entries and each one has a time stamp."
LuvAmore,10581835264,2023-11-13T08:18:21-07:00,1,"There are a lot of bells and whistles that encourages journaling, which I love, but Some users love the idea of digital journal with the old-school handwriting option. For years, I’ve tried, but the single page at a time is not a great setup, and half-baked support with scribble is not good at all. I prefer writing and find myself doing so in a different app and then screenshots into DayOne. It's not a great workflow.  All advertised input options should be tested and meet a minimum baseline.

However, with the voice dictation feature I’m able to express my thoughts in words. Talk about my day or an event that I want to detail what’s happening. This app help me do that.

It helps me see that as much as there is to do, we have done a lot in the last five years. That is motivating. I really want to pay the developer for this wonderful app and perhaps get more premium features. But the $35/year price point/model is just not who I am. I prefer to pay once, while I have the money. I like expensive tools, and I love using 30 year old tools because the value. I don’t like subscriptions because my attention comes and goes and I don’t like committing my future earnings just to read my diary.

sterlingts,10550151365,2023-11-04T11:52:11-07:00,5,"This app is EVERYTHING I need in a journaling app, and so much more! I’ve always been a pen to paper kind of journalist. One day I was sitting by a small river, with 3 different notebooks. As I was writing, I slipped a little bit on a rock, and almost dropped my notebook. I thought to my self, if I were to drop this notebook in the water, I’d lose everything in here. That made me think, maybe it’s time to go digital. At least it would all be backed up. I’ll fast forward a bit~ I tried several different apps, and I landed here. This app allows me to have everything in one place, it allows me to add pictures, songs, and really anything! It plays seamlessly between my computer, and phone (I pad if I wanted) and the convenience is incredible. It tracks where I made the entry, and the time (I’ve always had an interesting fascination with starting my entries with the date and exact time I’m journaling because I feel it captures the moment in it’s entirety. I’m writing this review at 11:37AM). It even captures the weather, which I suppose isn’t important (to me) but a fun detail. Ok, I’m trailing here~ this app is amazing, and I suggest you find out the features for yourself! I’m a daily journalist and this app lets me categorize everything exactly as I need it. I can search, and reference things as needed. I couldn’t possibly be more happy with an app! Everything is backed up, twice, and you can get your journals printed if you want them on the shelf! I haven’t used this feature yet, but I know the time will come. I do miss the tactile feel of writing on paper, but for what this app offers, the pros heavily outweigh the cons!!!!! At times when paper is what’s available,  I find my self taking a picture of the entry and logging it into the app. HERE’S YOUR SIGN, MAKE THE SWITCH. I can, nearly, guarantee you won’t regret it! I like that i have the option to password lock the app, because this is for me, and only me. I could go on, and on, but I’ll end this here. THIS IS THE ONLY APP I HAVE THAT I CAN SAY HAS TRULY CHANGED MY LIFE. For how much I journal, and what this app offers, I will gladly pay the subscription price :) JUST DO IT!"

Give it a spin and find a central repository with security options for everything - an uncluttered running diary of life so you can get back to living it. Free up brain space for creative, enjoyable endeavors rather than searching for stored info across too many platforms. The tagging and multiple journal capabilities are the key to your freedom.

Update: a great app to store Freeform boards as pdfs.  

Syncing is seamless across the Apple ecosystem and love making audio notes and journals which can be AI transcribed."

Basic level no longer allows addition of a photo. With basic you can add a photo to an entry which has worked for me for as long as I have used the app (almost 8 years). The latest version of the app asks you to sign up for premium when you try to add the photo. Help pages are useless as you have to sign up for a Wordpress domain to use the forums. And then you can’t log in that way either. No way to contact support other than a chatbot which asks you, again, to sign up for premium. I really like this app but this is a step backwards."

kasia4484,10458147038,2023-10-09T23:24:27-07:00,4,"Improvement in Handwriting Experience

Rating: ????? (4/5)

I've been using the Day One app for some time now, and I must say, I'm a huge fan. It's an excellent tool for digital journaling, offering a plethora of features that make it stand out. The seamless integration with various media types, robust tagging system, and intuitive interface are all top-notch.

However, there's one area where I find room for improvement—the Apple Pencil experience. As someone who enjoys a more handwritten journaling approach, I was hoping for a smoother and more immersive experience. Currently, the app allows for drawing and basic writing, but it doesn't quite capture the essence of a true handwritten journaling experience.

I believe that a substantial update in this aspect would be a game-changer. If the app could enhance the handwriting capabilities to provide a more natural and fluid writing experience, it would undoubtedly elevate the Day One app to a whole new level.

While I started with the one-month free trial, I have reservations about extending it and purchasing the upgrade, primarily due to this reason. However, I'd be more than willing to become a loyal, long-term client if this particular feature is addressed in future updates.

In summary, the Day One app is fantastic, but there's a potential for perfection in the handwriting department. With some tweaks and updates, this app could easily become a five-star favorite for many, including myself.

DrFunk,10448471716,2023-10-07T05:29:34-07:00,5,"I saw a video where a photographer was taking two seconds out of each day for a whole year and put it together in a few minutes of a movie. The images went flashing by in high speed, but your minds eye could capture the moment, and it was a memory brought forward. Fascinating how a short  movie was able to remind you of the whole year. I was all excited and thought I needed to do this however, that’s a lot of editing! So I found this app and decided that using the dictation system on the iPhone, and this app, I would start to record, the salient features of each day. I felt like life is going by too fast so I needed to record it. That was in 2019. Boy was I right because since then we’ve had multiple years of Covid, death in the family, issues at work and a national awards that my daughter got, all recorded in it in this app. After losing my wife, I’m so glad I have images and jokes and things to remember her by. I started recording 4 years before her death and now wish I had done this at the beginning. The app works flawlessly and I will continue to do so. I record a little something and some photo of each day. The stuff I want to remember and even the stuff I want to forget because I don’t wanna do that again! I finally printed out five books by now, so I have them on paper on my shelf. Time is your most valuable asset and we don’t record the events very well, thinking that will remember it all. Looking back at the books I can tell you those books are priceless. Thank you Day One."
M&TJones,10446713855,2023-10-06T16:42:20-07:00,5,"When I first bought this app it was on a whim as I was searching for a way to log my weight loss progress. I am not much of a journalist nor have I ever been, so I didn’t anticipate me keeping the app for a long period of time. Given that I would write about my efforts and then some other topic, then another, and another. It has now been years that I have had this app and I use it at least three times weekly. It’s simple to use on both my computer or phone. Thank you for the memories."
Paradyce90,10445610591,2023-10-06T09:08:12-07:00,5,"Absolutely love this app. It has helped me through so much! I used to journal the old fashioned way with a book and a pen, but this way I love so much better."
noluckpaying,10445210780,2023-10-06T07:04:11-07:00,1,Why not?  My phone and I've purchased other apps thru store
vgskhyre,10443251853,2023-10-05T17:38:26-07:00,5,I really like this one
therealpeculiarmom,10441137758,2023-10-05T04:48:36-07:00,5,"I’m using it in conjunction with Neurocycle app. Day one allows me to pour my true feeling thoughts into a journal without concern for it being read by someone. 
It locks you out every time which is good. Using facial recognition to open makes it easy. I can write out pages on paper and take a picture and load into my journal. It allows only one picture per journal entry on the free version. That seems fair."
slp591,10435696843,2023-10-03T16:51:16-07:00,5,I love this app it chronicles my life in such an accessible way. I love that I can attach pics and it show’s location of each entry.
LuNYC,10434118109,2023-10-03T06:35:44-07:00,5,I first used this to organize vacation photos. It keeps improving and I am constantly finding new uses for it.
bobbyb1999,10434102981,2023-10-03T06:30:52-07:00,5,"I love this app so so so much. I use it as a scrapbook/diary. They’ll even make it into a book for you for a decent price. I have it on my iPhone & MacBook. I’ll make my journal entries, add pictures that I love & it’s basically like an electronic scrapbook. The way the app is set up, it makes you want to post an entry. I subscribe to the premium version too. I’m obsessed."
Christinaeve24,10432830174,2023-10-02T21:37:10-07:00,5,I love this app! I love that I can search key words and find old things I wrote. This has helped me love writing in my journal.
Lynne C.,10425424575,2023-09-30T20:15:38-07:00,5,"I have been using Day One for years, and love it! The flexibility for several journals, the colors, fonts, indents, dates, media possibilities, editing capabilities are all delightful. I love being able to easily transfer an entry from one journal to another. This is one subscription I gladly pay for each year!

Update 9/30/23 - still absolutely in love with Day 1 Journal app!!!"
Tomcat228,10424832108,2023-09-30T15:59:04-07:00,5,I create poetry using AI and then add AI photos to create great stuff. The ease of use is amazing! I highly recommend this journal.
rina.888,10422096458,2023-09-29T23:02:20-07:00,1,Not user friendly
Fiafiafiafia,10421642083,2023-09-29T19:39:01-07:00,5,"The fact that journaling is helpful is nothing new. But I have horrible handwriting and I don’t carry my journal with me. In fact, thanks to day one, I don’t have one. 

I journal when it feels right. When I’m happy, when I’m sad, when I wake up from a confusing dream. It allows me the freedom to express myself when it need it most.

Also, I have two phones and they sync instantly and with full accuracy. That means it doesn’t matter what phone I have with me, or is nearest to me, I’m always up to date. 5 stars."
KatWalk65,10421441594,2023-09-29T18:15:37-07:00,5,"For a long time, I resisted this app because I already use Evernote, drafts, bear and too many archives of paper journals to want another journal. This deliberate chronicle, albeit digital, has its own set of new nightmares (e.g. losing brilliant drafts never to be recovered in this lifetime; 99 CENT pay wall hitting at that critical juncture where poverty and verisimilitude collide to disrupt the latest masterpiece with a Mephisto phenomenon option: or else!)

 I like the interface, platform, obvious intention & execution of this app. The ""interface"" to me means how I interact with the digital input of my thoughts and artist way type Journaling that I've been doing doe twenty odd years - so I want to pick up where I left off not have to adjust my creative process to some fraudulent fad, but rather seamlessly fold the ""platform"" which in this case is iphone app into my creative process. Which to some might be ""crazy"" or chaotic because I am highly creative. I don't want an application limiting the expression I have been honing over my 58 years on the planet. I appreciate the fluid format and ability to play with media within a post, love the fonts and am generally a huge fan. I went from premium at first to standard due to massive cuts in cash flow so all paid apps had to go until I could justify their value. I forsee at some point paying premium to complete an archive or print a thematic book. As a lifelong writer and photographer, a writer, Director and producer by trade and a storytelling maven by fate, I love this app and encourage writers or artist way type journal afficionadoes (those who use photorealism to convey their thoughts and emotions or visual poetry) out there to give it a try. It's pretty integrated so you can track your life archive across multiple tools and resources you already find useful in your digital dominion. I welcome the developers to set up.a forum for their loyal users to give more meaningful feedback. I'm genx and prefer contributing to projects that can best utilize my time investment. Cheers! Day in the life!"
sirblackader,10421428778,2023-09-29T18:10:10-07:00,5,"I've been journaling *daily* with DayOne since 2012. I probably wouldn't without it. Thanks for that!

However, I really wish they’d bring the inline tag pop up back."
jujubee524,10419558849,2023-09-29T06:10:49-07:00,5,I’ve journaled in the past starting when I was in grammar school and continued after that — but not on a regular basis. Day One is part of my daily routine and I love everything about it! Helps me get set up for the day as I journal right after I’ve done my daily list. The prompts are sometimes exactly what I need but if not I just start journaling. Well done! And thank you!
E@Epstein.net1,10417841169,2023-09-28T18:18:02-07:00,5,"I really enjoy it, especially that it works offline. I spend a lot of time offshore. I get lay/long photos, time and weather without needing to look it. Very handy for a sailing passage. I need to earn if there is a way to import old logs. Of have hundreds of days of logs in Excel."
Oluwanifemi_A,10417161032,2023-09-28T13:19:14-07:00,5,Thank you for existing. Just thank you

The unlikely architect,10415864707,2023-09-28T05:45:29-07:00,4,"I’ve been using this app since my wife died in 2007. I am writing it at least once a week and sometimes every day.

First of all it’s better for your health if you keep a diary and this is my diary. Secondly, it helps me keep a perspective on a certain situation and believes my stress level.

I can also look back at certain things and see if I’ve progressed to some thing that I had discussed attaining earlier in my life."
elyshium,10414876089,2023-09-27T22:36:55-07:00,5,I’ve always been in love with writing but never stayed consistent when it came to journaling. This app has managed to keep me hooked and continue writing on my journal every single day. I love the templates and the options to add photos or additional things on the entries. I’m definitely keeping my premium subscription!
RoryGi,10413545329,2023-09-27T12:15:25-07:00,5,"Bug fixed, thank you!"
T0wanda,10413494223,2023-09-27T11:55:11-07:00,4,I suddenly had problems loading my photos into the app. I’m glad to know the developers knew of the issue and are getting it fixed. I’m back in business. So grateful!
robgen,10413382563,2023-09-27T11:11:40-07:00,4,"I used this for years and loved it. For some reason the app lost my sign in, and when I reconnected it had dropped my premium status although I had just paid for it. And since I’m dropped from premium, I lost priortity for support.

I did finally find a way to contact the developer and the responded though. Which is a big point in their favor."
ShazarK,10412755323,2023-09-27T07:34:11-07:00,5,"I’ve always been an avid user of apps that help to organize my thoughts and writing. Day One stand stands out as one the best. Use it to coalesce all your digital work into one place. It’s a scrapbook of thoughts and projects and ideas and feelings; it’s an app that allows me to explore my inner world and chronicle my outer life.

The best parts: it reminds me of journal entries I made on this date years ago; the export to PDF function; the ability to get a printed book of my entries (great quality, I use it often).

I rarely write reviews or I use apps for so long. I’ve used Day One for the past several years, and enjoyed it immensely. It’s the perfect tool for keeping a record of my life journey."

Needs to be usable on other platforms besides Apple (e.g., Microsoft). I would appreciate the opportunity to use on my laptop (SurfacePro)."

From the daily prompts, to the “streak” awards, the tool is built to inspire writing. My favorite feature is the templates and reminder system to encourage me to write."
HB-hydrocephalus,10406082299,2023-09-25T08:32:17-07:00,5,I have a decade of using Day One under my belt and still love it.
Ele-2929,10404041708,2023-09-24T17:42:45-07:00,1,"I downloaded it because my husband has been using it, but it doesn't work the same on my phone. I cannot add even a single photo, even though it says one photo a day can be added with basic. I liked the idea of seeing a calendar with photo memories. But it just asks me to download premium. The only thing I can do for free is write. There are other journal apps that offer way more for free."
marissahm,10400566520,2023-09-23T18:56:55-07:00,5,i have been using the app since 2016 and i love it. five years of memories ??
Kay1937572,10398137866,2023-09-23T04:06:38-07:00,5,I love this app. It’s easy to use and you can add pictures to your journaling!! ????
oilandlinen,10395820647,2023-09-22T11:08:46-07:00,4,I’ve been using this app since 2015. I absolutely love it and will continue to use it. The interface is intuitive and clean. What frustrates me are some of the changes. The voice to text tech changed a few years back and never caught up with where it used to be. Yesterday I tried posting multiple photos to one entry and I could not. This is hugely frustrating as much of my entries used to be photos. Now we can only upload one photo a day? I do not use a lot of the integrations that this app can access. I just use the basic tools. Wondering if more things will be removed like the photos.

Superstar98,10391842440,2023-09-21T08:00:22-07:00,5,I started using Day One sometime back in 2019. I love how easy it makes journaling rather than sitting down to write I can just pull out my phone and make a quick note or journal on the go. I love that even the free version is useful and it doesn’t limit the number of entries you can make. Such a great app- I highly recommend!

BEA_000,10382002449,2023-09-18T10:58:39-07:00,2,"Guess my review was removed ...
I was an early user of this software and they kept ""updating"" to new versions and pricing in a way that didn't allow for previous data to convert and increased the price level substantially. It's hopefully pretty solid today, but I lost months of information, which totally defeats the purpose of keeping a journal. They only seemed concerned about making money and not the numerous inconvenient updates and difficult to apply patches."

diasapointedagain,10372089896,2023-09-15T15:00:39-07:00,1,This app does not deserve even one star. The idea is terrific but the execution is just awful. Lots of glitches which seem to get worse with each update. Probably time for new management and technologies.

Even though Apple is no longer supporting this phone, it really seems that a slightly older version would be available. Like the entry I made….oops, never mind. I can’t see the day I made that last entry, but it has been this year.

Let all who use this amazing, wonderful app to delineate your lives BEWARE. There was no warning that I would no longer be able to access my account. I think that I maybe could have downloaded my entries.

When will you become obsolete?"
Shad Berry,10348379115,2023-09-08T16:39:25-07:00,5,"Day One is wonderful. I love using the old school pen and paper however this app gives me a more enhanced journaling experience. With different templates and promote, I can easily write about the daily prompt and gives my brain time to process and eliminates writers block."
dglindsey23,11359417633,2024-06-08T17:10:33-07:00,3,"I will start off by saying this is the best journaling - even pure writing - app that I have found. I write on my iPad quite a bit and love to use slide-over and split-screen views to jot down thoughts in my journal while I am reading my Kindle book in the background. Hard to believe that Day One still craps out once you hit one full page of content within the app. Once you finish writing a full-page in slide-over or split-screen view, you can no longer see what you are writing because the app stops scrolling with your writing. You are writing “blind” so to speak. It is really hard to believe that this problem still persists after all these years and has frustrated me on more than one occasion. Simple problem - please fix this for the love of all that is good and holy."

I wish there was a way that I could have my Spotify playlist linked up to Day One so that it would sync with what I was listening to at the time while writing my entry. So I thought this option would work however it doesn’t work. I updated the app. I looked at all my settings on my iPhone and it does not work. I don’t know if this is a feature that is not working? I have the premium subscription too so I don’t know why it’s not working. It’s become incredibly annoying.. to try to figure it out."

PandaEyes87,11352473899,2024-06-06T22:10:03-07:00,4,"I know some users aren’t happy about DayOne’s new user update and how the UI looks very different now. It’s understandable that not everyone may like it. Personally, I liked the older UI much better, but am willing to give this new layout a fair try. 

Things might be a bit buggy and wonky while we all try to adapt to this new layout, but I’m sure those other things will be taken care of in time.

 I’ve been searching around for another journal app to use and nothing still comes close to DayOne. In my opinion, this is still the best journaling app out there and as long as they don’t continue to change things that make the app less user friendly and away from the original intentions of the app, I’m still willing to stick with them. 

Even when they do big updates like these that kind of has everyone mad about the change. As long as I try to get used to the change, then I think I will feel better about it later on."
venusamaris,11352062949,2024-06-06T19:04:40-07:00,3,"Updated to add: I do not love this new version. I have been using this app for years now. I always like the touches of color on the screen. Now they have stripped away nearly all the color. Why? It is so sterile and boring, and I honestly do not see the reason for the change. Were people complaining that it was too colorful. I kind of doubt that. Change for the sake of change is always a bad idea. Nothing about this latest update has improved my experience in using it. Learn to leave a good thing alone instead of messing it up in pursuit of a “fresh new look”.

Updated to add: I love the new location function in the latest update, it was just what I was hoping for. The developers are obviously trying hard to be responsive to users. They did not ""abandon iCloud"" here or charge money for an update. This is a NEW VERSION of Day One, and if you want to use it you will have to pay all of $5 - $10 (!), and learn to live with their excellent sync service. If you love the classic Day One, keep using it. It is not going away, or being abandoned. If you want iCloud sync, stick with the Classic version, do not expect this version to meet that need. The developers have done everything possible to communicate the fact that iCloud and Dropbox would not be available in v2, and why. It makes sense to me, and if I really want to keep using iCloud sync I can stick with Day One Classic. I recommend going to the developer website and reading their blog post from a week or so ago, which outlines why the changes and what they see as the benefit of using Day One Sync instead of iCloud. I have used Day One for a few years now, and I have always loved it. Journaling is very important in my life, I have done it since I was a kid and I have boxes of paper journals archived away. The original Day One was my go-to journal from the first day I downloaded it. I was a bit worried about the impending upgrade, I tip my hat to the developers of Day One for doing it right."

Put the control buttons back at the bottom where they were. They were easier to access and made more sense.

This latest update seems to be “change for change’s sake,” rather than needed functionality improvements."

So i looked through help and roughly speaking… sorry if you don’t have it tgere is ‘nothing Day One can do’ okay day one, im sire you’ll say its my fault for not ‘writing down ‘ some dumb A key from 8 years ago. 
It is my fault for trusting you. 
The worst paid app experience i ever had. Thanks for wasting entries ive had for 8 years.

I have no idea whats going on at Day Ine with the UI changes, but trust me on this.
Use “the free IOS journal."

I’m typing some pretty emotional stuff and for whatever reason, I guess a slight movement of my phone, the app tries to go in landscape mode and just shows a completely jacked up display (unusable or distinguishable screen the app is displaying since it glitched out trying to switch the orientation). Nothing makes it go back to normal so I close the app completely and open it back up. And just like that the last few minutes of writing are gone. That might not seem like a big deal but when you’re just pouring into something, it’s coming from the heart, you’re not thinking about remembering what you just typed. Why would you even make the app to do that? How is that even possible? Does your app just “save” every couple minutes? Even something as simple as the Notes app that comes with the phone has never done that - once you type it it’s there regardless of when or how quick you close the app. So right there I just didn’t like the experience and am going to look for another app. Completely throws off the experience and now you can’t even trust the app to do the most basic of things - save what you wrote."

I really love the app, however the new UI change is confusing and generally bad — I really enjoyed the old tab where you could see the daily streaks plus the color coded bars helped me know which journal I was in. Also, I have to click in twice to see the “on this day tab” when I’d much prefer it to be fixed above my entries. 

Like many other reviewers mentioned, the book tab seems slightly redundant. I hope the developers will take this feedback in mind. I initially was not going to write in a review, but after seeing others share similar sentiments, I think Dayone should reconsider their layout."

It has always been difficult to edit the appearance of June one line. I would like to change a single word to boldface type. Just can’t do it easily. Overall I have enjoyed using the app, but I’m always looking for something better. Wish the original developers could come back. Oh well, that’s progress.

Update 6/5/24

I’ve used the app extensively for the past day.  It had my vote for the “Ugliest App in the App Store 2024”, if that is an anti-reward category.   The developers really love shades of gray and off-whites.  I’m convinced the developers are color blind, so probably I should apologize to them."

Unforgivnn,11345024270,2024-06-04T23:11:58-07:00,2,"Hello-

Been using Day One Premium for years as a very satisfied (paying) customer.

That said, I have to echo many others. The new UI is absolutely awful. The new “book” view requires extra clicks to get to stats that used to be at the top of the list view. It is a waste of space and is completely unnecessary.

There was no problem with the previous UI and this feels like change for the sake of change to try to give the perception of “staying fresh”. As a software developer myself, this is one of the worst things I see other developers do.

After years of paying for Day One, I genuinely find myself considering finding an alternative. Rather than responding with “we are here to help you through the changes”, PLEASE listen to your customers and bring back the previous UI. I don’t need your “help”. I have figured out how to use the new UI and have quickly concluded that I hate it."

I have to close the app entirely and reopen and keep the app in portrait only to prevent crashing during note taking.

Overall despite this love the app and have for many years. I assume the problem will eventually be resolved but will give a one star to draw attention to issue."

Now it’s cramped up to the top and much less informative at a glance. I liked being able to see the numbers, like where my streak is at, without having to tap to open another menu, and it was much more visually appealing when there was some room to breathe at the top.

I also really miss the color bar at the top of each journal entry, so that you could see the journal in which you were writing. Now all individual entries look the same, regardless of which journal you are using so easy to mistake one journal for another. Can you please bring back the style, prior to the update, and can you please give us a prettier color to highlight with, such as a light yellow, green, pink, or blue, instead of mustard yellow?"

Kevin 72638393,11340246942,2024-06-03T15:16:38-07:00,1,"May 2024 UPDATE: They decided to totally change the UI. Yet again. It looks nothing like the award winning app of old, and they’re removing functionality (like you can’t see your sync status on the home screen anymore - arguably one of the most important functions of the app). The decline continues. I’m preparing to go to another journal service soon. I had high hopes but it’s clear Automatic is drastically changing things. This isn’t the Day One we all knew and loved. ANOTHER UPDATE: April 2024. Syncing is now a disaster. I’ve been down on multiple devices and despite half a dozen emails and tons of log files, support has no idea. What happened to you, Day One ?!?! Curse you, Automatic Inc, for the decline of what was once a shining example of a customer focused app with rock solid support. You are hastening people’s move off the platform. I WANT to use the app but every month there’s a new issue. Bugs are popping up all over. UPDATED AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE, 8/16/23: Nope, they're actually wrong. I'm a developer myself - you have a bug in your app. The exact commands referenced puts you in the same looped workflow of documentation and never opens the email client. And the revamped timeline still looks awful. I'm looking at alternative journal solutions - like Apple Journal or Bear Notes. Day One has gone backwards. UPDATED 8/1/23: They are making changes, and not for the better. Dropped from 3 stars to 2. They totally borked the time line view now - increasing the front size and adding useless data, so now you can only see like 3-4 entries at a time with lots of wasted space. Journal apps don't need constant UI changes. In fact - it's a problem. Journaling is a routine oriented task - and millions have adopted the Day One workflow. Changing it for no tangible benefit is crazy, and has me looking at Bear Notes and other alternatives. Who is driving these feature changes over there? It's getting worse... Oh - and despite being a premium user - you actually cannot contact support anymore! Their own documentation directs you to an area of the app that seems changed - it just redirects to old, outdated documentation instead of directing to an email message client. Yikes. If you are considering Day One as a newbie, consider something else. This app is not the clear winner it used to be. Fixes no one asked for, while user-favorite features (cough cough web app) are in perpetual Beta. OLD Review: The iOS app is great, but the application itself is severely lacking due to the recent, quiet, abandonment of their web browser app. They were working on it, and there was a highly anticipated beta - but it’s been shutdown and abandoned (they say temporarily, but it doesn’t look like it - they wouldn’t shut access down entirely if really temporary). There is currently no way to access any part of your journal on a windows desktop browser. So - the app is good, but it’s tedious in daily life as you can’t easily get items from your desktop into your journal."

It’s led to a frustrating journaling experience that is supposed to be an enjoyable and calming part of my day. I reached out to support and got an AI chat bot response.

I’d like to see the Underline come back.  

I’d like to see an array of user chosen highlighters from a color wheel.

The book mark is great, and the ability to word search is very good, but I’d like the ability to narrow down the word/quote search in a more refined way.

I believe that there is a lot of areas that can be addressed when journaling and so far, Day One has nailed all areas. It is an amazing program and though it has only been 5 days. I do feel as though this will be something I stick with. I typically use journaling to get through issues or concerns, and sometimes huge emotional challenges. Once I write them out I tend to stop journaling, but with Day On, I feel that the templates for added discussions as well as the daily question or prompt, will help me stay a head of the emotional black hole I end up in."

Mah Jongg Mommy,11249543596,2024-05-09T11:16:15-07:00,4,"This app is fantastic! I use it for quite a few things. 
I use it for regular journal.
I have 17 chronic diseases and I use it as a daily symptom tracker. 
**Here’s where the app could improve: I have created a few symbols which I saved to my photo library. Example, one is a bright lightening bolt for bad neuropathy days. Unfortunately, because I have already used this photograph on the day it was created, DAY ONE won’t permit me to use it multiple times so I can see it as the main image on the calendar. 
I want to see these symbols I have created so when I visit with one of my physicians, I am able to pull up the calendar to see how often I was having symptoms for a particular disease. 
Perhaps Day One could create actual symbols / sticker / feelings face, to add to actual calendar… for example if I was glancing at the month, even though there is a photograph of my dog, I could add a symbol to acknowledge something medical related. 
A ""+"" symbol on each day of the calendar would allow a person to add a necessary symbol (pretty much almost any emoji that is currently available on the keyboard would suffice). 
Users need a way to put something visible on the view of the monthly calendar so they can refer back to a specific day and not have to search through every entry to find what they were looking at. 
One symbol I made is ""HEALTH UPDATE"" it’s purple and turquoise. It takes the place of a personal photograph. However, because I created it January 3, 2024… Day One says I already used that photograph and I am not able to override it and use it again and again anytime I choose. 
*App should permit people to freely use the same photo as often as they choose… it’s their choice!
Otherwise… love the app!"

I have tried to send feedback but I am directed to a forum where I apparently have to have a “domain” and pay a fee in order to ask a question! Twice now, I’ve had issues where entries have not synced properly from my iPhone to my iPad. Only part of the entry transfers over. I get a message saying “there is a later version” but this so-called later version is actually the partial entry. The later part completely disappears, it’s not even visible in the cloud. So I have several paragraphs that no longer exist. I do not appreciate losing my writing, especially when I can’t get a message to the company about what is happening.

UPDATE: Developer, could you please explain to me when I try to access your forum, I am being directed to a site to create a “domain”? Why is that even necessary? The only way I can communicate with you is through this review."

Whatever you want to call it. We who bought your app from the early days. The ones who bought it SEPARATELY FOR ALL iOS iPad AND MACOS devices can now move along. Nothing to see here. Just call it whatever you want but no way is a subscription model worth anything when Apple has a perfectly great substitute NON SUBSCRIPTION ALTERNATIVE in the app store. You guys are all the same. Stop updating apps for those who were with you from the jump. Who overpaid from the jump because we believed in you. Wanted you to grow and succeed. Now its all cherry eyed happiness oh sorry no more updates we don’t need or want your support anymore. Just like Notability and all the rest. Good riddance. I will take my business elsewhere You don’t update or add features at hardly the rate to justify an annual subscription nor do you provide security for our personal journals.

I was looking for an app that would help me document my journey into the crafting world - saving photos, learning techniques etc.  but I soon was using it for documenting nearly everything in my life.  From being able to have multiple journals, to tags, and the ability to access my journals on all the platforms I use (iOS, Mac, Windows) - this app hits every checkmark for what I wanted in a journal, and more!  

I recently had to contact support for help with an issue, and immediately got a response (AI assistant), and when my issue was more complicated (so I thought), got an immediate response from one of their ""Happiness Engineers"".  That made me smile twice: first on reading it, and second because the help I got really made me happy!  (As it turned out - it wasn't anything with DayOne app, it was user error, but the Support folks were amazing in helping me understand what happened!)

From the way I plan my day. To the way I have learned to navigate my thoughts with more precision. It’s a must have. From the customization by colors of journals. To the sharing across devices. DayOne has effortlessly reawakened my love for writing. It’s a 5 star app. From a free user. I would love to see what a paid subscription could bring. I test the Beta and it’s def worth the money. Take the offer right away if you are presented with it. Don’t wait and miss out on the benefits it brings.

If you are more seasoned and/or you know how and what you want to write about each day, you can easily build a custom template and begin with the same template each day.  
I love being able to add pictures to the journal as well.  There are several ways you can use this, but I prefer to add any pictures from the to day to my daily journal entry.  Some of the other features include being able to add or include other types of media to your entry.  Although I personally do not use this feature, it is cool to know its there.

Thank you for making a great app and thank you for continuing to maintain and improve it!!"
Knittindoc,11109811818,2024-04-01T07:29:26-07:00,5,"Love Day One! Began writing daily on a challenge a few yrs back, have since grown to love my daily pondering, and especially seeing my pics from my phone for REAL when I send it to print 3x a yr!"
48th Parallel,11109778640,2024-04-01T07:19:30-07:00,5,"I don’t know that this review is worth much as I have never used any other digital journal but for my many purposes, Day One is perfect.  I liked it so much I purchased another subscription for my spouse but she still prefers a paper journal with her fountain pen.  And here’s where the huge differences between the two forms really shows up.  When she wants to find the date when something happened, it’s a laborious search.  I just type the event or name or place into the search feature and I get all the hits, the most recent entry first.  With Day One I can add photos, video links, emails, texts, or even parts of daily newsletters I get as instantly as a 72 year old man can do anything instantly.  I have separate journals for books bought, borrowed, and read, for projects I’m working on, and for travelogues.  For my spouse to do any of those things is nye impossible in a paper journal just from a space standpoint.  And if I too want the feel and flow of ink on paper, which I often do, I do just that and take a photo to enter on my digital journal.
	But it’s when you’ve been at Day One for awhile that some of it’s marvelous features begin to show up.  The “On This Day” feature is a treat.  For instance, today it shows that I have four entries for today.  To click on that and discover anew what I was doing three, four, five years ago today is, in addition to being fun and informative, a daily jolt regarding the passage of time.
	Two other features I love about Day One is that it syncs my journal across all my devices.  I can jot down an entry on my phone when I’m waiting in line at the car wash or having lunch in a diner.  I can check on an entry from last year when I’m on the go.  The other thing I prize is the privacy.  My Day One is password protected which allows me to be a little more free with personal details than I otherwise would be.
	Does Day One have some warts.  I’ve yet to meet an app that doesn’t but, again, for my needs this things I would like different are so few that I haven’t even bothered mentioning them to management.  I hope I’ve made it clear why I think this app deserves five stars."
lmatt12,11104518769,2024-03-30T19:59:31-07:00,5,Love this journal and look at it everyday.  I’ve been writing in it for 12 years now. I go look at what I was doing this day for the last 12 years. I don’t even remember some of the thing I wrote and I’m so glad for each and every memory. Thanks Day One for a quality product.
Sheila Burns,11103173456,2024-03-30T10:59:41-07:00,5,"One of the features I love, having used Day One for several years, is that it lets me know I have previous entries from same date in years past and of  gives me access to read entries from same dates in years past. 
 Day One also has a search feature that easily helps me to find topics that I wrote about last week or last year."
Macorin,11099772681,2024-03-29T13:03:54-07:00,2,"I bought Day One for iOS and OSX but didn’t feel the need to purchase a subscription. I would have if it offered features I couldn’t live without, but it doesn’t, so why spend the money unnecessarily? I’ve rated this app two stars because the journal is good, even if buggy at times. I couldn’t go more than two stars because I don’t think it’s right that they reserve live support for subscriptions only. I paid money for your apps and should be able to get support when needed. I can see giving subscription members priority support and making others wait longer, but to not offer live support to those that have supported and purchased your products before subscriptions were even a thing is just wrong. If a subscription offered me something I needed, I’d buy it, but I don’t need to add more than ten photos or videos to my entries. And I certainly won’t pay just to get support. In fact, that alone is reason enough to never buy the subscription. You might as well call your subscription a support plan, not a subscription."

I first got so annoyed that I started to reverse my order of journal entries so that the first thing I could do when I opened Word was write my newest journal entry! It eventually got so messy and long though, so then I thought, “there’s GOT to be something else out there!!! This is the 21st century for Christ’s sake!!!” Then, I opened the App Store and found Day One, and my life was literally changed forever, and I could not be more thankful for this app!!! ?????? I’m currently using Day One’s free premium trial, and it’s so great that I wish so so badly I could make my own money bc if I did, I would TOTALLY pay for a subscription immediately!!! Too bad I only have so long until my trial ends... ??"

I was so excited to use the new and improved version; however, it is constantly (and by constantly, I mean with each and every use) crashing. No matter what I try to do (write a new entry, look at historical entries etc) or where I try to do it (iPhone vs iPad), the app freezes, and the only way to fix the issue is to close the app and go back in. Further, even when I am typing on the new app, there is a big lag in the words. Please please please fix this. This app would be perfect if only it didn't freeze all the time!"

Yogiini Carolyn,11085342173,2024-03-25T14:29:26-07:00,5,"I keep about 12 sub journals concurrently with salient topics.  It has become a lifesaver for me as well as an easy way to check on a particular subject.

When I suffered with serious digestive issues, I started one titled Gastrointestinal.  Appointments with my gastroenterologist were very disappointing because he would say, “No coffee.”  Then when I read his notes concerning our office visits he would reiterate that the colonoscopies were unremarkable but I was described as labile.
     That really made me angry.  Of course I’m labile, if you were going through what I’m dealing with you would be labile, too!   I was actually contemplating how I could leave this plant without it looking like suicide.  It was that bad. 
     I thought, “OK, Buddy, you are about to get some journal entries.”  I copied about four horrendous days of entries and gave them to the receptionist for him to read before my next appointment.  They became part of my health record so they couldn’t be ignored.  
    Outcome:  he ordered an upper GI, lower GI and stool sample.  At last I was heard.  Result:  no pancreatic digestive enzymes and I needed supplementation.  I was normal at last after years of agony.
     If you have a chronic condition and are being gaslighted, I urge you to keep a journal on the symptoms and and how they are impacting your life.  Tell your story and be honest and graphic.  Dates and times and related events are important and helpful for diagnosis."

cpoetree,11081634725,2024-03-24T13:44:56-07:00,5,"Day One provides space and encouragement for more than a memoir, a diary or a daily journal.

With a provocative prompt for each day and the possibility to include images, it offers space for musing and personalizing life as we live it.

It is beautifully formatted, allowing search, dating and recall to happen easily.  Also, when one runs into a snag (and I have) help is readily available.  I have found it to be clear and effective.

If I could afford it, I would readily choose to update my Day One to premium.  Although I cannot, using Day One on a primary level is a delight this daily user would not miss.

Day One helps me grow!  Thank you to those who created it, maintain it and update it!  I'm beyond grateful."

With that, I purchased the premium, and since have experienced numerous quirks which have caused me to alter my opinion.

Far too frequently I have received “are you happy with your experience?” pop ups as I’m trying to utilize the app which appear in inconvenient locations (like over something I’m reading or trying to write)..and if that was annoying enough,..they have seldom worked, or went away, literally blocking my screen!!

Other times,..things I’ve clicked on direct to other places on the app I was not intending to see!

I would not be concerned about any of this had I not paid!

So unless they correct these bugs soon, I’ll be cancelling my subscription and would greatly warn anyone from paying for the premium package."

I tell people about it all the time because I have nothing but good things to say. There are so many features that I love about it! Just so incredibly well designed. I saw that Apple came out with a Journaling app but it doesn’t even come close to how perfectly developed this app is. 10 stars for me.

I try and I try but never manage to make it longer than a few weeks before I’ve given up on writing. Day One was recommended by a guest on The Tim Ferriss Show, so I decided to check it out. I’ve never loved something so much in my life. Writing has become part of my daily routine. The journal categories allow you to compartmentalize so many things and the fact that you can make notes on your phone to deep dive into later on the PC is just phenomenal. I can take create an entry while walking at the park and make quick notes of a podcast I’m listening to, then recall and complete the whole idea when I get home. If thoughts start creeping in while laying bed and I’m having difficulty falling asleep, again I can make a quick entry to dump the idea from my brain, and sleep comfortably knowing I can address the next morning on the pc. There’s just so much utility with this app. I love it. If I ever become a famous writer, this will be mentioned as one of my favorite and most valuable purchases of all time."

Don’t use many of the very advanced features, because it’s main function as a journal works so well. Records where you were, the weather and so much more automatically. I keep one journal for each car, and a Journal of “things” where I photo any warrenty item with the receipt. Has come in very handy! Do miss the widget that showed how many words you entered over the last 50 days, great for finding days you only started an entry."

I finally found a good journal app, I own a IPhone and recently they added a journal app I haven’t used to it but I’ve read some of the reviews and wasn’t convinced but this APP! I didn’t need to read any reviews! I started using it last year and I fell in love although I wish we could add more photos, I understand I have to pay but other that that it’s totally worth getting!

Here are the things I really like about Day One -

— can use across all my devices with ease
— I am able to copy, forward and even create PDFs of my entries when needed - this was a big let down with the apple journal app… I started using that until I realized that you cannot copy or export anything once it is in their app. 
— picture tagging - love that the app automatically goes to the pictures with the same date(s) as the journal entry.  Makes it so simple.
— hashtag capability - makes this easy to organize my journal in a way my mind works
—automatically imports instagram posts (now, we just need it to do the same for facebook - that’s where I posted a lot of my stuff before) 

Enhancements I would like to see:
—facebook post integration
—bible app integration would be AMAZING"

However last week I was scammed and lost access to my Apple ID. The scammers locked me out of it. I had to get a new id. I wrote to the support email explaining the situation and got back a template email with links to their FAQs- and said they only give individual support to those who pay. You call that good customer service? I don’t. I won’t be using their app again. I heard from the developer but I am still not satisfied. In fact, I am very angry. Any link you provide to offer help is a link to the help page. Option 1 is the Help guides which are links to articles and tutorials. Option 2 is the DayOne forum, but In order to write to the forum you must have an account on Wordpress-something I don’t care to have- even if the first year is free. The only other option on the page is for premium users, of which I was one but cannot use it because I lost the use of my AppleID. As I said above, I won’t be back.

I tried to write customer service but they told me I am not a premium user I am a free user so there’s not much help for me.

It also improves your typing and grammar but you don’t even work at it, you just get on the habit over time.

It says to email support and then tells you where to find the support email, only to find it does not exist there. I have clicked ‘Delete account’ many times and my account still exists.

It’s so convenient to have on my phone and I love that I can edit the time and add pictures and I especially love that I can add audio clips! Such a great app and I just hope it will continue to be as good as it is now and that I don’t lose all my entries!
CosmicNoidPizza,10982861105,2024-02-26T12:18:35-07:00,1,"Used to love Day One, but will be unsubscribing and uninstalling because I don’t trust my data being used by a transmisogynist CEO who breaches user data privacy just so he can make funny comebacks on Twitter, as well as making me pay $32/y for basic quality of life features like multiple journals. 

Switching to Diarium from here on out - it has just about everything Day One has, doesn’t require a subscription (only a one time fee for the same features Day One subscription-walls), plus it’s not run by people who gladly house transphobes and other bigots on their social media platforms."
Dan K Graham,10980563115,2024-02-25T20:35:49-07:00,5,"I never really journaled before, but I’ve heard it helps people be more mindful. I tried journaling with the iOS journal. I loved being able to journal whatever I want. However, I quickly realized it was lacking features such as the ability to back up entries outside of the app. I discovered Day One as an alternative. The app does every thing I need and more. I do think that there is some features that could be added on for quality of life. I hope the app keeps improving."
Balta87,10979362175,2024-02-25T11:41:47-07:00,5,"Very easy to use, very well made and has helped me keep up journaling. The biggest thing for me is the option to add a picture and have the entry revert to the time the picture was taken. This has helped me make many past entries that I felt I wanted in my journal. Such an easy but effective feature. Thank you all who made this app and continue to work on it!"
Bill R W,10976774653,2024-02-24T19:31:35-07:00,5,I don’t use a daily journal book anymore. This electronic version is a good electronic brother to the original physical journal book  used for so many years.

Misteramazinq,10974997693,2024-02-24T08:15:48-07:00,5,Updated Review: developer addressed my concern. This app is the best journal app out there. Looking forward to future improvements
Annchm,10965943554,2024-02-21T22:06:29-07:00,5,"Finally, I found the journal I’m looking for. This is the easiest journal in the world. The thing that I like most about this journal is that I have been used to using a five-year journal where I could see every year previous. I couldn’t find an online one that did this. This journal does! It shows you a year in review. I haven’t made it yet, but I’m happy to know that it’ll show me what I’ve done in previous years on the same day. A great journal! So easy to use."
houstonbruce,10952701238,2024-02-18T06:20:18-07:00,5,"UPDATE: February 2024
I really enjoy Day One. They make it convenient to journal. I also have a text reminder that reminds me, daily, to write. It is so convenient to do this, and often, I copy and paste messages I have written others, into my journaling process. Why write things twice.

One feature I want to explore more of is family journaling, but I am not sure my family would want to do this. 

Templates make things easier if you have repetitive forms of journaling in mind. 

UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2023 I do not really have any complaints with this app. It does what it says, and I feel that my data and personal information is reasonably-secure. I like being able to text my entries. Helpful if I have already written something I want to document that I have written to family or friends via text message. That was a feature I really liked—the ability the app had to ask if I wanted to open the application after using iOS Share Sheet to post a journal entry. If it went away, please bring it back. It is super-helpful to have the option to click and just go directly into the app."

It gives me a chance to reflect on each day and reminds me of the good things and experiences in my life.  The ability to add photos and memories is fantastic.
As I said it’s been 80 days since I started journaling and look forward to years as this is a great way to diary and reflect on your life experiences."
McCarthyAero,10948782130,2024-02-17T05:49:27-07:00,3,"I like the format for the most part. For some reason - perhaps a bug - entry’s will not record. The process goes like this. Hit the “plus” to begin the entry, type, perhaps a few photos. Hit “done” - poof! Gone. The entry is not saved. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. Frustrating."
OnHD,10938132431,2024-02-14T07:11:49-07:00,1,"I’m a PLUS legacy user. I find their weather service is in accurate and I don’t want my historical journal entries to be incorrect. That seems incompatible with why one journals to begin with. I’ve asked Support if I can disable the weather service entirely. However they declined to answer my question because I’m not a premium user I paid money for the version of the app that I use, and as a paying customer I expect some level of support at least for simple questions. I’m not pleased that this developer has chosen to ignore needs of non-premium paid users. I found you could ask this question of their automated online chat bot, and you get an answer, it’s just an answer that is not true, and it directs you to take steps with features that don’t exist.
2/14/24 Update: I did receive a developer response in informing me that my Plus plan was discontinued nine years ago. I’m well aware of that. My point was, while the plan may have been discontinued, I still purchased the app and the developer has my money. It’s my feeling that there should be some “support” quid pro quo connected to that fact, otherwise the developer has simply stiffed a paid customer. Don’t get me wrong, I still love the app and will continue to use it, as it far surpasses anything it’s competitors offer. I just feel cheated on the Support issue, and I think others should be aware of that."

macbookpro15,10934348008,2024-02-13T06:17:26-07:00,2,So I’ve used day one for the last 2 years and I have had a premium membership with them. Unfortunately the app quality has gone down over time with the app having a lot of bugs. This I understand to some extent however their support is very bad too. The turn around time for answers is over a week I have had several tickets with them and the answering took forever and at the end of the day their support engineers are just not equipped to do proper support. I literally figured out two issues on my own when their support was unable to help me one was with ordering a book and the other one was with the payment failing. In both cases doing a clean install and losing all the books I prepared fixed the issue. I think if they want to be around for a longer period of time they need to step up their game and go back to how they used to be.

Would be awesome to never have to revisit this again."
Retirwneercs,10909836423,2024-02-06T13:21:06-07:00,5,"Love your app and using it forever. Can’t say enough good things about it, but I do have one issue I would like you to address and that is could you make the scrubber bar on the iPhone etc I noticed it’s white. Could you make it a color so it stands out more. I missed it for the longest time before I realized it was even there. Just saying. It’s great when you scrub and the date appears next to it that makes it supper easy to find a particular date. Thats really smart. Thanks for an exceptional app

Oh yea almost forgot…Is there anyway you could do the find function so it’s highlighted? Whenever you do a find for something you need to look through the whole entire entry to see where it’s at as it’s never highlighted in yellow etc like most apps do. Is that a possibility to change that? I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for your great work."
Geekgirl1971,10907585644,2024-02-06T00:20:19-07:00,3,I’m very disappointed and upset with this app. I recorded my first audio recording last night. Then I went through the written dictation and corrected the grammar issues and mistakes it made with what I said. A process that took me 20-30 mins to fix. I hit done and it appeared to save. A few moments later I realized my entire entry just vanished. I’ve looked everywhere on my account and found nothing. What is the point of using this app if it doesn’t store my recordings. And how do I get to the cloud part of the app that’s showing at the top of the page? I sent a message through the contact us area but no one has bothered to respond. I’m not going to pay for an app that wastes my time and efforts.

1,497 streak today. The app keeps getting better. Now I can look back on 4 years of memories. It has been an easy process for me. Every morning after I do my daily devotional I do my entry from what I did the day before. Having the pictures to look back on is priceless. It’s also a good tool to look back on when I got my oil changed in my truck or when I fertilized the yard, etc by using the search feature. Love the app!"

I stated that another good friend has kept a journal since he was a boy. She told me… “It’s never too late to start!”

I started this journal that day, as a way of logging information for my grandchildren when they are older.  

Over the last 900 plus days, I’ve expanded how I use it to log a record of health related items.  I keep adding other things too.  Any time I have something that I think could be noteworthy, I log it.  For example something that might be useful in documentation of a legal matter or whatever.  

Lastly I make sure to log every day.  In addition to keeping track of my weight and exercise I’ve done, I’ve set a goal to actually do something during the day that is noteworthy.   Another way to say that is to make sure I don’t have to disappoint myself by stating that I didn’t do anything today!"

I’m looking for a new app or may just use the new Apple journal. I have been using this app for over a year without issue. Recently the template tab has been functioning erratically. I have put in several tech support requests and gotten a canned response. I have tried all the suggested / usual fixes without success. Review could be five stars but poor support response after several requests is bad.

I keep a regular photo journal here where I put time stamped curated photos, and this can be done at the end of each day, or a month later when you have some free time or are home sick or whatever. I also use this to jot down some story about an event or day f I want.

On any given day, I will snap a few pictures of something that brings me joy to include in this journal. I don't need to worry if the photo is 'good' or if anyone else will like it. It is just for me!  When I go back through my phone camera roll, most days have something, and there are fond memories!

This is also great for journalling trips, etc. 

I also keep a private journal (both are private, but this one double-checks before showing any previews on my screen), and this is where I vent, complain, record frustrating experiences, etc. It is so much easier to move on from something if you have documented how it made you feel. This journal helps me move past this, but also allows me to go back and process as needed, and can be a helpful reference for therapy sessions. 

Oh, there is also a email option where I can type an entry into an email that will send directly into my journal. I use this for longer entries. 

I really like having a separate app for all of this to avoid feeling like it might be a Google or Apple product that I might feel stuck with later."

I use it for a day to day list  at the end of my day to remember daily events.  I use it for different workshops and classes I attend.  For poetry writing.  For a prayer journal.  I love the search feature.  I used to keep handwritten journals but then lost track of things I had written.  I do wish there was an easier way to transfer a document into a word document.

I’ve lost interest in the public aspect and paper journals are almost more than I want to do on a daily basis. I found Day One through the Wonder Tools newsletter and decided to try it out. 

It’s packed with features. Even if you don’t know what to write, there are handy templates and prompts to help you develop a writing habit. For me, it’s therapeutic and helps me work out things in my life through thought and documentation. 

I really can’t recommend it enough."

However, I cannot understand how they expect people to type a 1-2 page journal every day on their phone. This doesn’t make sense at all. Yes, the app is nice with lots of features, but there has to be a PC version, or at least a web version that does’t look like an 8 grader designed and developed it.

Staring at an empty page and feeling the need to write something profound. Or journal prompts I found didn’t really resonate or inspire me. I recently found Day One and I’m addicted! It’s only day 6 and I already have 17 entries. The prompts allow me to explore and be curious. Even though I’ve reused journal prompts on different days, it’s never boring. Each day brings new opportunities and obstacles and so the prompts feel brand new. I cannot tell you how much this app has helped with my mental health and overall happiness. This is literally the second review I’ve ever written but I had to because it was so important to me. Download it!! You won’t regret it."

I tried fixing it by turning off the iPhone and even deleted and reinstalled the app a couple of times but that didn't work, then. 

I next contacted the apps help line and got a message back that my problem would be passed on to their tech people.

Today I tried again to make a new entry on the iPhone app and it still froze so then I tried deleting the app and afterwards turning off my iPhone for five minutes.

When I reinstalled Day One app on my iPhone and waited till after it synced with icloud downloading all my past entries I again tried to make a new entry and this time it worked!

I  guess that the apps tech must have been working on it so my deleting the app and reinstalling it this time worked,  so if you have the same problem try it!

Unusable - I did contact support and they confirmed the issue.  Terrible development and QC for user interface.  This should have been addressed before release if they wanted to have customers using iPads."

I often dictate voice to text. I really like the ability to have multiple journals for different purposes. Does everything I need it to, and I feel a huge relief that I’m finally capturing the important details of life again.

UsefulReviewsNow,10764437988,2023-12-30T15:00:30-07:00,4,"The journaling concept is amazing. It meets all my needs and is by far the best free app of its kind. Unfortunately, there are a lot of drawbacks if you don’t choose the premium plan, which is roughly $36/year. For instance, if you don’t want to splurge on premium, you can not add videos or multiple photos into one entry. It is to be noted that you can add one photo per entry without premium. Also, there is no cross-device sharing without premium. You can’t start on your phone and end on your Mac unless you pay the price.

Overall, these don’t detract from an otherwise enjoyable journaling experience, but without premium, the line is thin between Day One and the standard Apple Notes app."

DayOne is integrated across the iOS platform, so you can quickly send photos, articles, or inspiration from around the internet to your journal. The tagging and searching are top notch. You can even create separate journals for different projects or themes.

One of the best features is the location, weather, and activity logging that seamlessly integrate into new entries. When I’m out and about, I take a lot of pictures, but don’t always add them to DayOne the same day. When I create a new entry, I can add the photos and am immediately prompted to apply the photo date and location, so it keeps everything in order.

I love how the developer keeps making DayOne better. I know Apple has launched their own journalling app, but I’m committed to this wonderful app that has stood the test of time and is now a daily feature in my life."

Day One is a little different than Evernote, but just as useful.  I have almost 50 journals on various topics and time periods.  I use the app to keep track of my business and my nonprofit.  I take notes for the books I’m writing.  I use Day One to remember important things.  My entries often use pictures, videos, and audio files.  The whole thing is searchable.  It is my brain, stored on a handy device in my pocket.  For 2024, I plan to use Day One even more, recording notes and thoughts from almost every aspect of my life.  It is effortless to use.  I hope it remains just the way it is, for many years into the future.  One improvement I wouldn’t mind would be if the voice to text was a little more accurate sometimes.

I love writing, but I have always struggled with sitting down to write and getting overwhelmed while staring at a blank page. This app has a dictation feature which allows me to speak freely while the app transcribes it in real time. You can then go back and edit later. This is incredibly useful to me in the mornings, when most of my ideas hit me, but I have very little time to write them down because I’m getting ready for work. This app allows you to record and leave it running so you can simply talk at your device when you have something that you want to write down. There are many incredibly useful features in here, but the transcription is the one that wins the day for me.

Dnabryant247,10720375527,2023-12-19T18:04:31-07:00,5,"Day One is by far the best journaling app I have come across. Its user experience is unmatched, providing a seamless and visually appealing interface. The GUI is simply beautiful, making the act of journaling a delightful experience. One standout feature is the effortless insertion of media from the current date, allowing me to easily enhance my memories. Additionally, Day One offers simple markdown support, enabling me to format my entries exactly how I want them. 
The inclusion of daily prompts adds a creative touch, sparking inspiration for my journaling journey. I particularly appreciate the ""On this day"" pop-ups that remind me of my thoughts and experiences from a year ago, giving me a chance to reflect and appreciate my own growth. Furthermore, Day One rewards users for creating streaks, encouraging consistency in journaling. Overall, Day One surpasses all other journaling apps with its unmatched user experience and  features."

Its developers never listened to users and called us “vocal minority” when we asked for something THEY did not like. Removed all the great features from the app, photo stream was great once, now it’s no different from regular photo app, limited many features under subscription. Broke the book printing (our family bought a plan and tried 5 times to print the book - never worked, support couldn’t help). So it brings us to the present day with an app crippled by its own creator. Well, classic human story with its roots in the ancient scriptures."

A password recovery email was sent, I followed the link, and it would open up a Chrome tab directly to my account.

Which means that someone would merely need to have my email and request an account recovery and have direct access to my day one account on Chrome.

As an extension, the password recovery would do as I have outlined above and to change my password I wouldn’t have to reenter the password that I forgot.

Lastly, when I go to speak with customer support or “contact customer support I don’t actually get to contact anybody. I am directed to the FAQs or their forum, which to post, and I need to sign in."

I tried the recent apple journal, but at this time, there’s no comparison. I suspect though, apple might iterate to the point where dayone might start need to worry, even the paid version of dayone.

Now they just made the previous app unusable and replaced it with this new one so that they could get more money. Original app you paid once and you were done. Now they try to make you pay a monthly fee for “premium” to get basically the same thing as what I already owned. They don’t even offer like a curtesy credit for the users who had paid for the previous app. They didn’t do any of this to benefit the consumer. They did it to get more money. Why would I pay for a monthly subscription to write like I can on the built in iPhone notes app?! Ridiculous

Day One
iOS notes
Notebooks by Afons Schmid

I’ve whittled it down to two : 
 iOS Notes and Day One.

I’ve been using iOS notes for 15 years. I have used Day One in the past. But wasn’t satisfied with it. Then they did a super upgrade to it and it appears as though it’s a strong contender for the best Notes app. I’ve compared iOS notes with Day One feature by feature, capability by capability. So far Day One is  in the lead. But it’s close. I’ll post again when I’ve decided."
craignye,10682324970,2023-12-11T07:04:33-07:00,1,"Day One needs to separate tech issues which they won’t discuss with you unless you are a premium member, with book creation and billing which. Nobody needs to pay extra to talk to a company when they don’t or won’t fill out your order and take your money on top of it."
La Nikacia,10680633807,2023-12-10T19:21:51-07:00,1,"I got to the registration page and had the option of signing up with my Apple face recognition or email and password. My short term memory has been failing due to health issues which is why I wanted the app in the first place. 

Knowing that I’d inevitably randomly get signed out and get flustered and upset having to reset a password I wouldn’t remember, I chose to sign in with Apple. The app read my face and accepted it. Then…nothing. I could never get past that page even after the face scan recognized me every time. 

If just accessing the app doesn’t work correctly, how annoying is using it going to be? Deleting it right away. Disappointed, it looked fun and helpful."
SpiderKisses21,10674383659,2023-12-09T05:34:55-07:00,5,I would highly recommend this journal. You can have as many little journals as you want.

My phone is always nearby and usually in my hands.  It is so easy to jot down some thoughts and feelings whenever they arise. 

I looked at several apps and deleted all except this one.  I use it on the simplest level.   It has tons of features, but they are not intrusive.  Just there if I want them.  

The typing practice on my phone is an added bonus."

Lalit Mishra,10651625209,2023-12-02T20:41:29-07:00,5,"Day One Journal App stands out as a premier digital journaling platform, providing a seamless and enriched experience for capturing life's moments. Its interface is elegantly simple, inviting users to document their thoughts and activities without the distraction of cluttered toolbars.

One of Day One's most compelling features is its versatility. Whether you're a minimalist who appreciates the one-click entry system and clean design or a detail-oriented person who enjoys cataloging entries with metadata like location, weather, and music, Day One caters to all. The app's use of templates and prompts ingeniously lowers the barrier to journaling, making it accessible even when inspiration is scarce.

For those who like to journal on-the-go, Day One's multimedia capabilities allow for a rich recording of experiences, enabling users to add photos, videos, and even audio to their entries. The app also respects the private nature of journaling, offering robust security features to protect personal musings.

Customizable reminders are another innovative aspect, helping users build a consistent journaling habit by setting multiple prompts throughout the day, tailored to their schedule.

In essence, Day One excels not just as a digital journal but as a companion for life's journey, providing a versatile, secure, and user-friendly space to document personal growth, reflect on experiences, and store memories."

Making a habit of using Day One has saved me time, lowered my anxiety, and saved me money. 
It’s worth the subscription. Get it. 

The longer version that ADHDers in particular will see themselves in and understand:

Losing time finding things, buying things you think will fix you but you never use, buying another of the thing you can’t find or forgot you already have, is the “ADHD Tax.” I’ve paid. 
(I personally consider losing writing, ideas, and pictures part of the ADHD tax.)  

Day One  is the first app (or physical book) I’ve ever used regularly. I did have to build the habit, but it wasn’t hard because Day One is effortless. 

I have many lovely journals. a couple bujos, planners, and the guilt from not using them. 
I used to have a lot of stuff “somewhere” and had to go on a safari every time I needed any of it. 

I use Day One for journaling, saving ideas for projects, corralling spicy social media drafts and angry emails safely away from that “send” button, cataloging stuff in bins, boxes, and baskets, venting, pet pictures, and checklisting.  
It’s a boss feeling when you think, “Where is the (insert thing  here)?” and I can look it up, see it’s in Bin 3, grab it, and get back to what I was doing. 
Day One has tagging so it’s even easier to find that #blue faux fur or tell yourself #Go Me. 

My one and only beef  is that Day One is a subscription instead of a purchase. I’d love a version I could buy and set to back up to Dropbox or my personal cloud storage. 
On the other hand, this year’s cost of using Day One is definitely less than an unused planner and replacing a jacket."

I have it on both my iPhone and iPad; I'm comfortable with the features and functionality and it syncs well with both devices. I'd be much more consistent in journaling if I was just able to access it through the internet with a desktop.

It helps me see that as much as there is to do, we have done a lot in the last five years. That is motivating. I really want to pay the developer for this wonderful app and perhaps get more premium features. But the $35/year price point/model is just not who I am. I prefer to pay once, while I have the money. I like expensive tools, and I love using 30 year old tools because the value. I don’t like subscriptions because my attention comes and goes and I don’t like committing my future earnings just to read my diary. Other apps do offer single fee OR subscription models, and I purchased them."

One other bonus feature for me, if I happen to get busy and forget to send a photo with a comment, it will ask if I want to backdate it to the photo date. So far the only drawback is the look is a bit rudimentary and hard to really view on phone, no options. But this is my go to for documenting my day."

sterlingts,10550151365,2023-11-04T11:52:11-07:00,5,"This app is EVERYTHING I need in a journaling app, and so much more! I’ve always been a pen to paper kind of journalist. One day I was sitting by a small river, with 3 different notebooks. As I was writing, I slipped a little bit on a rock, and almost dropped my notebook. I thought to my self, if I were to drop this notebook in the water, I’d lose everything in here. That made me think, maybe it’s time to go digital. At least it would all be backed up. I’ll fast forward a bit~ I tried several different apps, and I landed here. This app allows me to have everything in one place, it allows me to add pictures, songs, and really anything! It plays seamlessly between my computer, and phone (I pad if I wanted) and the convenience is incredible. It tracks where I made the entry, and the time (I’ve always had an interesting fascination with starting my entries with the date and exact time I’m journaling because I feel it captures the moment in it’s entirety. I’m writing this review at 11:37AM). It even captures the weather, which I suppose isn’t important (to me) but a fun detail. Ok, I’m trailing here~ this app is amazing, and I suggest you find out the features for yourself! I’m a daily journalist and this app lets me categorize everything exactly as I need it. I can search, and reference things as needed. I couldn’t possibly be more happy with an app! Everything is backed up, twice, and you can get your journals printed if you want them on the shelf! I haven’t used this feature yet, but I know the time will come. I do miss the tactile feel of writing on paper, but for what this app offers, the pros heavily outweigh the cons!!!!! At times when paper is what’s available,  I find my self taking a picture of the entry and logging it into the app. HERE’S YOUR SIGN, MAKE THE SWITCH. I can, nearly, guarantee you won’t regret it! I like that i have the option to password lock the app, because this is for me, and only me. I could go on, and on, but I’ll end this here. THIS IS THE ONLY APP I HAVE THAT I CAN SAY HAS TRULY CHANGED MY LIFE. For how much I journal, and what this app offers, I will gladly pay the subscription price :) JUST DO IT!"

Day One is the place where everything comes together - all links (music, video, pdf, photos) bookmarks, accounting, reading, recipes, journaling. Give it a spin and find a central repository with security options for everything - an uncluttered running diary of life so you can get back to living it. Free up brain space for creative, enjoyable endeavors rather than searching for stored info across too many platforms. The tagging and multiple journal capabilities are the key to your freedom.

Update: a great app to store Freeform boards as pdfs.  

Syncing is seamless across the Apple ecosystem and love making audio notes and journals which can be AI transcribed."

Basic level no longer allows addition of a photo. With basic you can add a photo to an entry which has worked for me for as long as I have used the app (almost 8 years). The latest version of the app asks you to sign up for premium when you try to add the photo. Help pages are useless as you have to sign up for a Wordpress domain to use the forums. And then you can’t log in that way either. No way to contact support other than a chatbot which asks you, again, to sign up for premium. I really like this app but this is a step backwards."

kasia4484,10458147038,2023-10-09T23:24:27-07:00,4,"Improvement in Handwriting Experience

Rating: ????? (4/5)

I've been using the Day One app for some time now, and I must say, I'm a huge fan. It's an excellent tool for digital journaling, offering a plethora of features that make it stand out. The seamless integration with various media types, robust tagging system, and intuitive interface are all top-notch.

However, there's one area where I find room for improvement—the Apple Pencil experience. As someone who enjoys a more handwritten journaling approach, I was hoping for a smoother and more immersive experience. Currently, the app allows for drawing and basic writing, but it doesn't quite capture the essence of a true handwritten journaling experience.

I believe that a substantial update in this aspect would be a game-changer. If the app could enhance the handwriting capabilities to provide a more natural and fluid writing experience, it would undoubtedly elevate the Day One app to a whole new level.

While I started with the one-month free trial, I have reservations about extending it and purchasing the upgrade, primarily due to this reason. However, I'd be more than willing to become a loyal, long-term client if this particular feature is addressed in future updates.

In summary, the Day One app is fantastic, but there's a potential for perfection in the handwriting department. With some tweaks and updates, this app could easily become a five-star favorite for many, including myself.

Kasia"

DrFunk,10448471716,2023-10-07T05:29:34-07:00,5,"I saw a video where a photographer was taking two seconds out of each day for a whole year and put it together in a few minutes of a movie. The images went flashing by in high speed, but your minds eye could capture the moment, and it was a memory brought forward. Fascinating how a short  movie was able to remind you of the whole year. I was all excited and thought I needed to do this however, that’s a lot of editing! So I found this app and decided that using the dictation system on the iPhone, and this app, I would start to record, the salient features of each day. I felt like life is going by too fast so I needed to record it. That was in 2019. Boy was I right because since then we’ve had multiple years of Covid, death in the family, issues at work and a national awards that my daughter got, all recorded in it in this app. After losing my wife, I’m so glad I have images and jokes and things to remember her by. I started recording 4 years before her death and now wish I had done this at the beginning. The app works flawlessly and I will continue to do so. I record a little something and some photo of each day. The stuff I want to remember and even the stuff I want to forget because I don’t wanna do that again! I finally printed out five books by now, so I have them on paper on my shelf. Time is your most valuable asset and we don’t record the events very well, thinking that will remember it all. Looking back at the books I can tell you those books are priceless. Thank you Day One."

This deliberate chronicle, albeit digital, has its own set of new nightmares (e.g. losing brilliant drafts never to be recovered in this lifetime; 99 CENT pay wall hitting at that critical juncture where poverty and verisimilitude collide to disrupt the latest masterpiece with a Mephisto phenomenon option: or else!)

 I like the interface, platform, obvious intention & execution of this app. The ""interface"" to me means how I interact with the digital input of my thoughts and artist way type Journaling that I've been doing doe twenty odd years - so I want to pick up where I left off not have to adjust my creative process to some fraudulent fad, but rather seamlessly fold the ""platform"" which in this case is iphone app into my creative process. Which to some might be ""crazy"" or chaotic because I am highly creative. I don't want an application limiting the expression I have been honing over my 58 years on the planet. I appreciate the fluid format and ability to play with media within a post, love the fonts and am generally a huge fan. I went from premium at first to standard due to massive cuts in cash flow so all paid apps had to go until I could justify their value. I forsee at some point paying premium to complete an archive or print a thematic book. As a lifelong writer and photographer, a writer, Director and producer by trade and a storytelling maven by fate, I love this app and encourage writers or artist way type journal afficionadoes (those who use photorealism to convey their thoughts and emotions or visual poetry) out there to give it a try. It's pretty integrated so you can track your life archive across multiple tools and resources you already find useful in your digital dominion. I welcome the developers to set up.a forum for their loyal users to give more meaningful feedback. I'm genx and prefer contributing to projects that can best utilize my time investment. Cheers!

The best parts: it reminds me of journal entries I made on this date years ago; the export to PDF function; the ability to get a printed book of my entries (great quality, I use it often).

I rarely write reviews or I use apps for so long. I’ve used Day One for the past several years, and enjoyed it immensely. It’s the perfect tool for keeping a record of my life journey."

What frustrates me are some of the changes. The voice to text tech changed a few years back and never caught up with where it used to be. Yesterday I tried posting multiple photos to one entry and I could not. This is hugely frustrating as much of my entries used to be photos. Now we can only upload one photo a day?

I write on my iPad quite a bit and love to use slide-over and split-screen views to jot down thoughts in my journal while I am reading my Kindle book in the background. Hard to believe that Day One still craps out once you hit one full page of content within the app. Once you finish writing a full-page in slide-over or split-screen view, you can no longer see what you are writing because the app stops scrolling with your writing. You are writing “blind” so to speak. It is really hard to believe that this problem still persists after all these years and has frustrated me on more than one occasion.

Things might be a bit buggy and wonky while we all try to adapt to this new layout, but I’m sure those other things will be taken care of in time.

 I’ve been searching around for another journal app to use and nothing still comes close to DayOne. In my opinion, this is still the best journaling app out there and as long as they don’t continue to change things that make the app less user friendly and away from the original intentions of the app, I’m still willing to stick with them. 

Even when they do big updates like these that kind of has everyone mad about the change. As long as I try to get used to the change, then I think I will feel better about it later on."
venusamaris,11352062949,2024-06-06T19:04:40-07:00,3,"Updated to add: I do not love this new version. I have been using this app for years now. I always like the touches of color on the screen. Now they have stripped away nearly all the color. Why? It is so sterile and boring, and I honestly do not see the reason for the change. Were people complaining that it was too colorful. I kind of doubt that. Change for the sake of change is always a bad idea. Nothing about this latest update has improved my experience in using it. Learn to leave a good thing alone instead of messing it up in pursuit of a “fresh new look”.

Updated to add: I love the new location function in the latest update, it was just what I was hoping for. The developers are obviously trying hard to be responsive to users. They did not ""abandon iCloud"" here or charge money for an update. This is a NEW VERSION of Day One, and if you want to use it you will have to pay all of $5 - $10 (!), and learn to live with their excellent sync service. If you love the classic Day One, keep using it. It is not going away, or being abandoned. If you want iCloud sync, stick with the Classic version, do not expect this version to meet that need. The developers have done everything possible to communicate the fact that iCloud and Dropbox would not be available in v2, and why. It makes sense to me, and if I really want to keep using iCloud sync I can stick with Day One Classic. I recommend going to the developer website and reading their blog post from a week or so ago, which outlines why the changes and what they see as the benefit of using Day One Sync instead of iCloud. I have used Day One for a few years now, and I have always loved it. Journaling is very important in my life, I have done it since I was a kid and I have boxes of paper journals archived away. The original Day One was my go-to journal from the first day I downloaded it. I was a bit worried about the impending upgrade, I tip my hat to the developers of Day One for doing it right."

I’m typing some pretty emotional stuff and for whatever reason, I guess a slight movement of my phone, the app tries to go in landscape mode and just shows a completely jacked up display (unusable or distinguishable screen the app is displaying since it glitched out trying to switch the orientation). Nothing makes it go back to normal so I close the app completely and open it back up. And just like that the last few minutes of writing are gone. That might not seem like a big deal but when you’re just pouring into something, it’s coming from the heart, you’re not thinking about remembering what you just typed. Why would you even make the app to do that? How is that even possible? Does your app just “save” every couple minutes? Even something as simple as the Notes app that comes with the phone has never done that - once you type it it’s there regardless of when or how quick you close the app. So right there I just didn’t like the experience and am going to look for another app. Completely throws off the experience and now you can’t even trust the app to do the most basic of things - save what you wrote."

I really love the app, however the new UI change is confusing and generally bad — I really enjoyed the old tab where you could see the daily streaks plus the color coded bars helped me know which journal I was in. Also, I have to click in twice to see the “on this day tab” when I’d much prefer it to be fixed above my entries. 

Like many other reviewers mentioned, the book tab seems slightly redundant. I hope the developers will take this feedback in mind. I initially was not going to write in a review, but after seeing others share similar sentiments, I think Dayone should reconsider their layout."

It has always been difficult to edit the appearance of June one line. I would like to change a single word to boldface type. Just can’t do it easily. Overall I have enjoyed using the app, but I’m always looking for something better. Wish the original developers could come back. Oh well, that’s progress.

Update 6/5/24

I’ve used the app extensively for the past day.  It had my vote for the “Ugliest App in the App Store 2024”, if that is an anti-reward category.   The developers really love shades of gray and off-whites.  I’m convinced the developers are color blind, so probably I should apologize to them."

Unforgivnn,11345024270,2024-06-04T23:11:58-07:00,2,"Hello-

Been using Day One Premium for years as a very satisfied (paying) customer.

That said, I have to echo many others. The new UI is absolutely awful. The new “book” view requires extra clicks to get to stats that used to be at the top of the list view. It is a waste of space and is completely unnecessary.

There was no problem with the previous UI and this feels like change for the sake of change to try to give the perception of “staying fresh”. As a software developer myself, this is one of the worst things I see other developers do.

After years of paying for Day One, I genuinely find myself considering finding an alternative. Rather than responding with “we are here to help you through the changes”, PLEASE listen to your customers and bring back the previous UI. I don’t need your “help”. I have figured out how to use the new UI and have quickly concluded that I hate it."
RevanRem,11344614904,2024-06-04T20:01:04-07:00,1,"Latest update crashes the app when a journal is open and switches from portrait to landscape mode and then back to portrait.  Keyboard stays in landscape and minimizing and reopening the app doesn’t fix the issue and crashes.

I have to close the app entirely and reopen and keep the app in portrait only to prevent crashing during note taking.

Overall despite this love the app and have for many years. I assume the problem will eventually be resolved but will give a one star to draw attention to issue."

Now it’s cramped up to the top and much less informative at a glance. I liked being able to see the numbers, like where my streak is at, without having to tap to open another menu, and it was much more visually appealing when there was some room to breathe at the top. Would be nice to have the option to go back to the previous layout. There doesn’t seem to be any value add to this new change in looks."

Then they respond to the complaint saying “we know adapting to change is hard”. Do not gaslight me. I have used this app for four years and I loved it. You need some customer service training. Do not trust these people to have any continuation of product. A journal app is a personal investment. They broke trust."

Recently though, I noticed a glitch where my journal entry lists are highlighted in the very unattractive yellow color at times, even though those were not highlighted by me, nor do they look highlighted when I open the individual entry. 

I also really miss the color bar at the top of each journal entry, so that you could see the journal in which you were writing. Now all individual entries look the same, regardless of which journal you are using so easy to mistake one journal for another. Can you please bring back the style, prior to the update, and can you please give us a prettier color to highlight with, such as a light yellow, green, pink, or blue, instead of mustard yellow?"

Kevin 72638393,11340246942,2024-06-03T15:16:38-07:00,1,"May 2024 UPDATE: They decided to totally change the UI. Yet again. It looks nothing like the award winning app of old, and they’re removing functionality (like you can’t see your sync status on the home screen anymore - arguably one of the most important functions of the app). The decline continues. I’m preparing to go to another journal service soon. I had high hopes but it’s clear Automatic is drastically changing things. This isn’t the Day One we all knew and loved. ANOTHER UPDATE: April 2024. Syncing is now a disaster. I’ve been down on multiple devices and despite half a dozen emails and tons of log files, support has no idea. What happened to you, Day One ?!?! Curse you, Automatic Inc, for the decline of what was once a shining example of a customer focused app with rock solid support. You are hastening people’s move off the platform. I WANT to use the app but every month there’s a new issue. Bugs are popping up all over. UPDATED AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE, 8/16/23: Nope, they're actually wrong. I'm a developer myself - you have a bug in your app. The exact commands referenced puts you in the same looped workflow of documentation and never opens the email client. And the revamped timeline still looks awful. I'm looking at alternative journal solutions - like Apple Journal or Bear Notes. Day One has gone backwards. UPDATED 8/1/23: They are making changes, and not for the better. Dropped from 3 stars to 2. They totally borked the time line view now - increasing the front size and adding useless data, so now you can only see like 3-4 entries at a time with lots of wasted space. Journal apps don't need constant UI changes. In fact - it's a problem. Journaling is a routine oriented task - and millions have adopted the Day One workflow. Changing it for no tangible benefit is crazy, and has me looking at Bear Notes and other alternatives. Who is driving these feature changes over there? It's getting worse... Oh - and despite being a premium user - you actually cannot contact support anymore! Their own documentation directs you to an area of the app that seems changed - it just redirects to old, outdated documentation instead of directing to an email message client. Yikes. If you are considering Day One as a newbie, consider something else. This app is not the clear winner it used to be. Fixes no one asked for, while user-favorite features (cough cough web app) are in perpetual Beta. OLD Review: The iOS app is great, but the application itself is severely lacking due to the recent, quiet, abandonment of their web browser app. They were working on it, and there was a highly anticipated beta - but it’s been shutdown and abandoned (they say temporarily, but it doesn’t look like it - they wouldn’t shut access down entirely if really temporary). There is currently no way to access any part of your journal on a windows desktop browser. So - the app is good, but it’s tedious in daily life as you can’t easily get items from your desktop into your journal."

It’s led to a frustrating journaling experience that is supposed to be an enjoyable and calming part of my day. I reached out to support and got an AI chat bot response. I will likely be canceling my subscription to this app and looking for another app from a different developer. Sad and frustrated since this app was awesome before they decided to change it."

Design is a matter of taste. I don’t like it but perhaps other will love it. But some of the design decisions seems at least strange - who needs the book tab under which there is almost nothing actionable. 

But lack of functionality and plenty of bugs is unforgivable. Who needs the calendar when there is no opportunity to move fast to other date. Search is not working correctly.

I had previously given Day One a one star due to the fact the app was frozen. Several days the app icon was overlaid with the download progress widget and it would not open. It was also frozen on the App Store. The open option on the store did not work.  That problem was resolved by deleting the app through iPhone settings. That allowed the App Store to download a new copy of the app.

Since my encryption key was saved in the iCloud, the new download works great and all my journal entries are intact.

I don’t use the text or email entry features, I find it easy enough to open the app and tap the journal I need. 

There are so many more ways I could be using this app, but I am satisfied with the basic functionality of journal access on the fly. I have had reminders set up for morning and evening, but I find that I just ignore them. I love this app most for jotting down in the moment thoughts and feelings, unloading after a hard day at work, drafting letters and memos, capturing career/work ideas, snapping pics of meaningful moments on hikes, and as a place to record  health information (I snap pics of after-visit notes from doctors).

I’d like to see a LOT more formatting and editing features.  I’d like to see advanced notation abilities.  

I’d like to see a Grammarly based system for auto grammar, spelling and punctuation.  

I’d like to see a suite of dictionaries that cover synonyms, Thesaurus, other languages… and an easy way to call up the one the user needs.

I’d like to see the Underline come back.  

I’d like to see an array of user chosen highlighters from a color wheel.

The book mark is great, and the ability to word search is very good, but I’d like the ability to narrow down the word/quote search in a more refined way.  I usually forget the word that I want to recall.  I also ask myself something like, “When did I write about such and such?” and don’t remember a single descriptive thing about the entry.

I do feel as though this will be something I stick with. I typically use journaling to get through issues or concerns, and sometimes huge emotional challenges.

I use it for regular journal.
I have 17 chronic diseases and I use it as a daily symptom tracker. 
**Here’s where the app could improve: I have created a few symbols which I saved to my photo library. Example, one is a bright lightening bolt for bad neuropathy days. Unfortunately, because I have already used this photograph on the day it was created, DAY ONE won’t permit me to use it multiple times so I can see it as the main image on the calendar. 
I want to see these symbols I have created so when I visit with one of my physicians, I am able to pull up the calendar to see how often I was having symptoms for a particular disease. 
Perhaps Day One could create actual symbols / sticker / feelings face, to add to actual calendar… for example if I was glancing at the month, even though there is a photograph of my dog, I could add a symbol to acknowledge something medical related. 
A ""+"" symbol on each day of the calendar would allow a person to add a necessary symbol (pretty much almost any emoji that is currently available on the keyboard would suffice). 
Users need a way to put something visible on the view of the monthly calendar so they can refer back to a specific day and not have to search through every entry to find what they were looking at. 
One symbol I made is ""HEALTH UPDATE"" it’s purple and turquoise. It takes the place of a personal photograph. However, because I created it January 3, 2024… Day One says I already used that photograph and I am not able to override it and use it again and again anytime I choose. 
*App should permit people to freely use the same photo as often as they choose… it’s their choice!
Otherwise… love the app!"

I have tried to send feedback but I am directed to a forum where I apparently have to have a “domain” and pay a fee in order to ask a question! Twice now, I’ve had issues where entries have not synced properly from my iPhone to my iPad. Only part of the entry transfers over. I get a message saying “there is a later version” but this so-called later version is actually the partial entry. The later part completely disappears, it’s not even visible in the cloud. So I have several paragraphs that no longer exist. I do not appreciate losing my writing, especially when I can’t get a message to the company about what is happening.

UPDATE: Developer, could you please explain to me when I try to access your forum, I am being directed to a site to create a “domain”? Why is that even necessary? The only way I can communicate with you is through this review."

Whatever you want to call it. We who bought your app from the early days. The ones who bought it SEPARATELY FOR ALL iOS iPad AND MACOS devices can now move along. Nothing to see here. Just call it whatever you want but no way is a subscription model worth anything when Apple has a perfectly great substitute NON SUBSCRIPTION ALTERNATIVE in the app store. You guys are all the same. Stop updating apps for those who were with you from the jump. Who overpaid from the jump because we believed in you. Wanted you to grow and succeed. Now its all cherry eyed happiness oh sorry no more updates we don’t need or want your support anymore. Just like Notability and all the rest. Good riddance.

I was looking for an app that would help me document my journey into the crafting world - saving photos, learning techniques etc.  but I soon was using it for documenting nearly everything in my life.  From being able to have multiple journals, to tags, and the ability to access my journals on all the platforms I use (iOS, Mac, Windows) - this app hits every checkmark for what I wanted in a journal, and more!  

I recently had to contact support for help with an issue, and immediately got a response (AI assistant), and when my issue was more complicated (so I thought), got an immediate response from one of their ""Happiness Engineers"".  That made me smile twice: first on reading it, and second because the help I got really made me happy!  (As it turned out - it wasn't anything with DayOne app, it was user error, but the Support folks were amazing in helping me understand what happened!)

From the way I plan my day. To the way I have learned to navigate my thoughts with more precision. It’s a must have. From the customization by colors of journals. To the sharing across devices. DayOne has effortlessly reawakened my love for writing. It’s a 5 star app. From a free user. I would love to see what a paid subscription could bring. I test the Beta and it’s def worth the money.

Some of the things that I love about the app include pre-populated templates to begin your journaling.  If you have never journaled, this makes it easy to get started because you don’t have to think about what to write about.  If you are more seasoned and/or you know how and what you want to write about each day, you can easily build a custom template and begin with the same template each day.  
I love being able to add pictures to the journal as well.  There are several ways you can use this, but I prefer to add any pictures from the to day to my daily journal entry.  Some of the other features include being able to add or include other types of media to your entry.  Although I personally do not use this feature, it is cool to know its there.

48th Parallel,11109778640,2024-04-01T07:19:30-07:00,5,"I don’t know that this review is worth much as I have never used any other digital journal but for my many purposes, Day One is perfect.  I liked it so much I purchased another subscription for my spouse but she still prefers a paper journal with her fountain pen.  And here’s where the huge differences between the two forms really shows up.  When she wants to find the date when something happened, it’s a laborious search.  I just type the event or name or place into the search feature and I get all the hits, the most recent entry first.  With Day One I can add photos, video links, emails, texts, or even parts of daily newsletters I get as instantly as a 72 year old man can do anything instantly.  I have separate journals for books bought, borrowed, and read, for projects I’m working on, and for travelogues.  For my spouse to do any of those things is nye impossible in a paper journal just from a space standpoint.  And if I too want the feel and flow of ink on paper, which I often do, I do just that and take a photo to enter on my digital journal.
	But it’s when you’ve been at Day One for awhile that some of it’s marvelous features begin to show up.  The “On This Day” feature is a treat.  For instance, today it shows that I have four entries for today.  To click on that and discover anew what I was doing three, four, five years ago today is, in addition to being fun and informative, a daily jolt regarding the passage of time.
	Two other features I love about Day One is that it syncs my journal across all my devices.  I can jot down an entry on my phone when I’m waiting in line at the car wash or having lunch in a diner.  I can check on an entry from last year when I’m on the go.  The other thing I prize is the privacy.  My Day One is password protected which allows me to be a little more free with personal details than I otherwise would be.
	Does Day One have some warts.  I’ve yet to meet an app that doesn’t but, again, for my needs this things I would like different are so few that I haven’t even bothered mentioning them to management.  I hope I’ve made it clear why I think this app deserves five stars."
lmatt12,11104518769,2024-03-30T19:59:31-07:00,5,Love this journal and look at it everyday.  I’ve been writing in it for 12 years now. I go look at what I was doing this day for the last 12 years. I don’t even remember some of the thing I wrote and I’m so glad for each and every memory. Thanks Day One for a quality product.
Sheila Burns,11103173456,2024-03-30T10:59:41-07:00,5,"One of the features I love, having used Day One for several years, is that it lets me know I have previous entries from same date in years past and of  gives me access to read entries from same dates in years past. 
 Day One also has a search feature that easily helps me to find topics that I wrote about last week or last year."
Macorin,11099772681,2024-03-29T13:03:54-07:00,2,"I bought Day One for iOS and OSX but didn’t feel the need to purchase a subscription. I would have if it offered features I couldn’t live without, but it doesn’t, so why spend the money unnecessarily? I’ve rated this app two stars because the journal is good, even if buggy at times. I couldn’t go more than two stars because I don’t think it’s right that they reserve live support for subscriptions only. I paid money for your apps and should be able to get support when needed. I can see giving subscription members priority support and making others wait longer, but to not offer live support to those that have supported and purchased your products before subscriptions were even a thing is just wrong. If a subscription offered me something I needed, I’d buy it, but I don’t need to add more than ten photos or videos to my entries. And I certainly won’t pay just to get support. In fact, that alone is reason enough to never buy the subscription. You might as well call your subscription a support plan, not a subscription."

I first got so annoyed that I started to reverse my order of journal entries so that the first thing I could do when I opened Word was write my newest journal entry! It eventually got so messy and long though, so then I thought, “there’s GOT to be something else out there!!! This is the 21st century for Christ’s sake!!!” Then, I opened the App Store and found Day One, and my life was literally changed forever, and I could not be more thankful for this app!!! ?????? I’m currently using Day One’s free premium trial, and it’s so great that I wish so so badly I could make my own money bc if I did, I would TOTALLY pay for a subscription immediately!!! Too bad I only have so long until my trial ends... ??"
YourRegGrlGamer,11096709454,2024-03-28T17:30:00-07:00,5,The recording of your life will become invaluable later in life. This app’s feature makes it easy to do that. The ability to sync between devices is a win over apples basic journal app.

I was so excited to use the new and improved version; however, it is constantly (and by constantly, I mean with each and every use) crashing. No matter what I try to do (write a new entry, look at historical entries etc) or where I try to do it (iPhone vs iPad), the app freezes, and the only way to fix the issue is to close the app and go back in. Further, even when I am typing on the new app, there is a big lag in the words. Please please please fix this. This app would be perfect if only it didn't freeze all the time!"

It is easy to keep track of my life and look back over the years to see how far I’ve come.
10/10 recommend and I often give a subscription of this as a gift to family and friends."
Yogiini Carolyn,11085342173,2024-03-25T14:29:26-07:00,5,"I keep about 12 sub journals concurrently with salient topics.  It has become a lifesaver for me as well as an easy way to check on a particular subject.

When I suffered with serious digestive issues, I started one titled Gastrointestinal.  Appointments with my gastroenterologist were very disappointing because he would say, “No coffee.”  Then when I read his notes concerning our office visits he would reiterate that the colonoscopies were unremarkable but I was described as labile.
     That really made me angry.  Of course I’m labile, if you were going through what I’m dealing with you would be labile, too!   I was actually contemplating how I could leave this plant without it looking like suicide.  It was that bad. 
     I thought, “OK, Buddy, you are about to get some journal entries.”  I copied about four horrendous days of entries and gave them to the receptionist for him to read before my next appointment.  They became part of my health record so they couldn’t be ignored.  
    Outcome:  he ordered an upper GI, lower GI and stool sample.  At last I was heard.  Result:  no pancreatic digestive enzymes and I needed supplementation.  I was normal at last after years of agony.
     If you have a chronic condition and are being gaslighted, I urge you to keep a journal on the symptoms and and how they are impacting your life.  Tell your story and be honest and graphic.  Dates and times and related events are important and helpful for diagnosis."
bfg_3,11084090077,2024-03-25T07:10:28-07:00,5,I have been using this app since 2015. I got as a Starbucks app download when they used to do an app of the week. It is hands down the best journaling app. Intuitive layout and clean design.
Hgxykihnechj,11082077936,2024-03-24T16:43:41-07:00,5,Layout and ease of use are top notch!
cpoetree,11081634725,2024-03-24T13:44:56-07:00,5,"Day One provides space and encouragement for more than a memoir, a diary or a daily journal.

With a provocative prompt for each day and the possibility to include images, it offers space for musing and personalizing life as we live it.

It is beautifully formatted, allowing search, dating and recall to happen easily.  Also, when one runs into a snag (and I have) help is readily available.  I have found it to be clear and effective.

If I could afford it, I would readily choose to update my Day One to premium.  Although I cannot, using Day One on a primary level is a delight this daily user would not miss.

Day One helps me grow!  Thank you to those who created it, maintain it and update it!  I'm beyond grateful."

With that, I purchased the premium, and since have experienced numerous quirks which have caused me to alter my opinion.

Far too frequently I have received “are you happy with your experience?” pop ups as I’m trying to utilize the app which appear in inconvenient locations (like over something I’m reading or trying to write)..and if that was annoying enough,..they have seldom worked, or went away, literally blocking my screen!!

Other times,..things I’ve clicked on direct to other places on the app I was not intending to see!

I would not be concerned about any of this had I not paid!

So unless they correct these bugs soon, I’ll be cancelling my subscription and would greatly warn anyone from paying for the premium package."

I tell people about it all the time because I have nothing but good things to say. There are so many features that I love about it! Just so incredibly well designed. I saw that Apple came out with a Journaling app but it doesn’t even come close to how perfectly developed this app is. 10 stars for me.

I try and I try but never manage to make it longer than a few weeks before I’ve given up on writing. Day One was recommended by a guest on The Tim Ferriss Show, so I decided to check it out. I’ve never loved something so much in my life. Writing has become part of my daily routine. The journal categories allow you to compartmentalize so many things and the fact that you can make notes on your phone to deep dive into later on the PC is just phenomenal. I can take create an entry while walking at the park and make quick notes of a podcast I’m listening to, then recall and complete the whole idea when I get home. If thoughts start creeping in while laying bed and I’m having difficulty falling asleep, again I can make a quick entry to dump the idea from my brain, and sleep comfortably knowing I can address the next morning on the pc. There’s just so much utility with this app. I love it. If I ever become a famous writer, this will be mentioned as one of my favorite and most valuable purchases of all time."

Don’t use many of the very advanced features, because it’s main function as a journal works so well. Records where you were, the weather and so much more automatically. I keep one journal for each car, and a Journal of “things” where I photo any warrenty item with the receipt. Has come in very handy! Do miss the widget that showed how many words you entered over the last 50 days, great for finding days you only started an entry."

I finally found a good journal app, I own a IPhone and recently they added a journal app I haven’t used to it but I’ve read some of the reviews and wasn’t convinced but this APP! I didn’t need to read any reviews! I started using it last year and I fell in love although I wish we could add more photos, I understand I have to pay but other that that it’s totally worth getting! I love this app. Especially when I’m out and need to write and don’t have my journal with me this helps me so much! 

Thank you guys it’s helped me so much with my mental health love ya??"
~Mindy J,11055105306,2024-03-17T08:51:26-07:00,5,"I write a lot and I tend to have “journals” all over the place.  I decided recently to convert all the many to a single journal.  I was surprised how difficult that small task would end up being.  

Here are the things I really like about Day One -

— can use across all my devices with ease
— I am able to copy, forward and even create PDFs of my entries when needed - this was a big let down with the apple journal app… I started using that until I realized that you cannot copy or export anything once it is in their app. 
— picture tagging - love that the app automatically goes to the pictures with the same date(s) as the journal entry.  Makes it so simple.
— hashtag capability - makes this easy to organize my journal in a way my mind works
—automatically imports instagram posts (now, we just need it to do the same for facebook - that’s where I posted a lot of my stuff before) 

Enhancements I would like to see:
—facebook post integration
—bible app integration would be AMAZING"

Apple’s new Journal app doesn’t have a recurring cost, and hesitant to pay a recurring price for an app that I can’t keep fully unlocked long term.  I have apps that I have purchased from 2009 still kicking just fine without monthly or yearly subscription fees."

However last week I was scammed and lost access to my Apple ID. The scammers locked me out of it. I had to get a new id. I wrote to the support email explaining the situation and got back a template email with links to their FAQs- and said they only give individual support to those who pay. You call that good customer service? I don’t. I won’t be using their app again. I heard from the developer but I am still not satisfied. In fact, I am very angry. Any link you provide to offer help is a link to the help page. Option 1 is the Help guides which are links to articles and tutorials. Option 2 is the DayOne forum, but In order to write to the forum you must have an account on Wordpress-something I don’t care to have- even if the first year is free. The only other option on the page is for premium users, of which I was one but cannot use it because I lost the use of my AppleID. As I said above, I won’t be back. I found another solution for my needs. Have a nice life!"

Now the app is making me either log out and delete everything and re-login and upload everything or I have to delete the app and reinstall it for it to notice that I’m a plus user. I tried to write customer service but they told me I am not a premium user I am a free user so there’s not much help for me.

Adding the option for friends to edit entries would greatly enhance our ability to work on the journal together. Thank you for considering this feature addition!"

It also improves your typing and grammar but you don’t even work at it, you just get on the habit over time.

Balta87,10979362175,2024-02-25T11:41:47-07:00,5,"Very easy to use, very well made and has helped me keep up journaling. The biggest thing for me is the option to add a picture and have the entry revert to the time the picture was taken. This has helped me make many past entries that I felt I wanted in my journal. Such an easy but effective feature. Thank you all who made this app and continue to work on it!"
Bill R W,10976774653,2024-02-24T19:31:35-07:00,5,I don’t use a daily journal book anymore. This electronic version is a good electronic brother to the original physical journal book  used for so many years.
Nikki 8417,10975147311,2024-02-24T09:02:35-07:00,5,"This app was just what I was looking for I’m able to create as many journals to keep sections of my life separate but all in one place, with photos, videos voice recordings.  With rich encouragements.  Worth the money!"
Misteramazinq,10974997693,2024-02-24T08:15:48-07:00,5,Updated Review: developer addressed my concern. This app is the best journal app out there. Looking forward to future improvements
Annchm,10965943554,2024-02-21T22:06:29-07:00,5,"Finally, I found the journal I’m looking for. This is the easiest journal in the world. The thing that I like most about this journal is that I have been used to using a five-year journal where I could see every year previous. I couldn’t find an online one that did this. This journal does! It shows you a year in review. I haven’t made it yet, but I’m happy to know that it’ll show me what I’ve done in previous years on the same day. A great journal! So easy to use."
houstonbruce,10952701238,2024-02-18T06:20:18-07:00,5,"UPDATE: February 2024
I really enjoy Day One. They make it convenient to journal. I also have a text reminder that reminds me, daily, to write. It is so convenient to do this, and often, I copy and paste messages I have written others, into my journaling process. Why write things twice.

One feature I want to explore more of is family journaling, but I am not sure my family would want to do this. 

Templates make things easier if you have repetitive forms of journaling in mind. 

UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2023 I do not really have any complaints with this app. It does what it says, and I feel that my data and personal information is reasonably-secure. I like being able to text my entries. Helpful if I have already written something I want to document that I have written to family or friends via text message. That was a feature I really liked—the ability the app had to ask if I wanted to open the application after using iOS Share Sheet to post a journal entry. If it went away, please bring it back. It is super-helpful to have the option to click and just go directly into the app."
DayOneMike,10950625040,2024-02-17T16:42:01-07:00,5,"I have been using Day One for the past 80 days and absolutely enjoy the experience with this app.
It gives me a chance to reflect on each day and reminds me of the good things and experiences in my life.  The ability to add photos and memories is fantastic.
As I said it’s been 80 days since I started journaling and look forward to years as this is a great way to diary and reflect on your life experiences."
McCarthyAero,10948782130,2024-02-17T05:49:27-07:00,3,"I like the format for the most part. For some reason - perhaps a bug - entry’s will not record. The process goes like this. Hit the “plus” to begin the entry, type, perhaps a few photos. Hit “done” - poof! Gone. The entry is not saved. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. Frustrating."
OnHD,10938132431,2024-02-14T07:11:49-07:00,1,"I’m a PLUS legacy user. I find their weather service is in accurate and I don’t want my historical journal entries to be incorrect. That seems incompatible with why one journals to begin with. I’ve asked Support if I can disable the weather service entirely. However they declined to answer my question because I’m not a premium user I paid money for the version of the app that I use, and as a paying customer I expect some level of support at least for simple questions. I’m not pleased that this developer has chosen to ignore needs of non-premium paid users. I found you could ask this question of their automated online chat bot, and you get an answer, it’s just an answer that is not true, and it directs you to take steps with features that don’t exist.
2/14/24 Update: I did receive a developer response in informing me that my Plus plan was discontinued nine years ago. I’m well aware of that. My point was, while the plan may have been discontinued, I still purchased the app and the developer has my money. It’s my feeling that there should be some “support” quid pro quo connected to that fact, otherwise the developer has simply stiffed a paid customer. Don’t get me wrong, I still love the app and will continue to use it, as it far surpasses anything it’s competitors offer. I just feel cheated on the Support issue, and I think others should be aware of that."

macbookpro15,10934348008,2024-02-13T06:17:26-07:00,2,So I’ve used day one for the last 2 years and I have had a premium membership with them. Unfortunately the app quality has gone down over time with the app having a lot of bugs. This I understand to some extent however their support is very bad too. The turn around time for answers is over a week I have had several tickets with them and the answering took forever and at the end of the day their support engineers are just not equipped to do proper support. I literally figured out two issues on my own when their support was unable to help me one was with ordering a book and the other one was with the payment failing. In both cases doing a clean install and losing all the books I prepared fixed the issue. I think if they want to be around for a longer period of time they need to step up their game and go back to how they used to be.

The problem is resolved, I have access to my templates, and as promised, taking the review back to where it belongs.

Would be awesome to never have to revisit this again."
Retirwneercs,10909836423,2024-02-06T13:21:06-07:00,5,"Love your app and using it forever. Can’t say enough good things about it, but I do have one issue I would like you to address and that is could you make the scrubber bar on the iPhone etc I noticed it’s white. Could you make it a color so it stands out more. I missed it for the longest time before I realized it was even there. Just saying. It’s great when you scrub and the date appears next to it that makes it supper easy to find a particular date. Thats really smart. Thanks for an exceptional app

Oh yea almost forgot…Is there anyway you could do the find function so it’s highlighted? Whenever you do a find for something you need to look through the whole entire entry to see where it’s at as it’s never highlighted in yellow etc like most apps do. Is that a possibility to change that? I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for your great work."
Geekgirl1971,10907585644,2024-02-06T00:20:19-07:00,3,I’m very disappointed and upset with this app. I recorded my first audio recording last night. Then I went through the written dictation and corrected the grammar issues and mistakes it made with what I said. A process that took me 20-30 mins to fix. I hit done and it appeared to save. A few moments later I realized my entire entry just vanished. I’ve looked everywhere on my account and found nothing. What is the point of using this app if it doesn’t store my recordings. And how do I get to the cloud part of the app that’s showing at the top of the page? I sent a message through the contact us area but no one has bothered to respond. I’m not going to pay for an app that wastes my time and efforts.

I used to be the biggest pen to paper journaler, but having the ability to include all my pictures makes this journal by far my favorite method. I love the ability to make multiple journals.

1,497 streak today. The app keeps getting better. Now I can look back on 4 years of memories. It has been an easy process for me. Every morning after I do my daily devotional I do my entry from what I did the day before. Having the pictures to look back on is priceless. It’s also a good tool to look back on when I got my oil changed in my truck or when I fertilized the yard, etc by using the search feature. Love the app!"

I stated that another good friend has kept a journal since he was a boy. She told me… “It’s never too late to start!”

I started this journal that day, as a way of logging information for my grandchildren when they are older.  

Over the last 900 plus days, I’ve expanded how I use it to log a record of health related items.  I keep adding other things too.  Any time I have something that I think could be noteworthy, I log it.  For example something that might be useful in documentation of a legal matter or whatever.  

Lastly I make sure to log every day.  In addition to keeping track of my weight and exercise I’ve done, I’ve set a goal to actually do something during the day that is noteworthy.   Another way to say that is to make sure I don’t have to disappoint myself by stating that I didn’t do anything today!"

Edited to add Will use until my subscription runs out, maybe. Have had an issue with the template feature for over three weeks without a fix. The below goes into detail. I’m looking for a new app or may just use the new Apple journal. I have been using this app for over a year without issue. Recently the template tab has been functioning erratically. I have put in several tech support requests and gotten a canned response. I have tried all the suggested / usual fixes without success. Review could be five stars but poor support response after several requests is bad.

I keep a regular photo journal here where I put time stamped curated photos, and this can be done at the end of each day, or a month later when you have some free time or are home sick or whatever. I also use this to jot down some story about an event or day f I want.

On any given day, I will snap a few pictures of something that brings me joy to include in this journal. I don't need to worry if the photo is 'good' or if anyone else will like it. It is just for me!  When I go back through my phone camera roll, most days have something, and there are fond memories!

This is also great for journalling trips, etc. 

I also keep a private journal (both are private, but this one double-checks before showing any previews on my screen), and this is where I vent, complain, record frustrating experiences, etc. It is so much easier to move on from something if you have documented how it made you feel. This journal helps me move past this, but also allows me to go back and process as needed, and can be a helpful reference for therapy sessions. 

Oh, there is also a email option where I can type an entry into an email that will send directly into my journal. I use this for longer entries. 

I really like having a separate app for all of this to avoid feeling like it might be a Google or Apple product that I might feel stuck with later."

I use it for a day to day list  at the end of my day to remember daily events.  I use it for different workshops and classes I attend.  For poetry writing.  For a prayer journal.  I love the search feature.  I used to keep handwritten journals but then lost track of things I had written.  I do wish there was an easier way to transfer a document into a word document.

It’s packed with features. Even if you don’t know what to write, there are handy templates and prompts to help you develop a writing habit. For me, it’s therapeutic and helps me work out things in my life through thought and documentation.

However, I cannot understand how they expect people to type a 1-2 page journal every day on their phone. This doesn’t make sense at all. Yes, the app is nice with lots of features, but there has to be a PC version, or at least a web version that does’t look like an 8 grader designed and developed it. Especially when Day One is the most expensive journal “solution” out there. Honestly, I have no idea why people give this a 5 star, but I bet my life they are all Mac users. Deleted."

I journal on my phone whenever I don’t have my iPad, or don’t have the energy to sit down and type for ten minutes. I have always wanted to journal daily, but the lack of access to my physical journal everyday made that hard. Day One makes that excuse negligible."

Staring at an empty page and feeling the need to write something profound. Or journal prompts I found didn’t really resonate or inspire me. I recently found Day One and I’m addicted! It’s only day 6 and I already have 17 entries. The prompts allow me to explore and be curious. Even though I’ve reused journal prompts on different days, it’s never boring. Each day brings new opportunities and obstacles and so the prompts feel brand new. I cannot tell you how much this app has helped with my mental health and overall happiness. This is literally the second review I’ve ever written but I had to because it was so important to me. Download it!! You won’t regret it."

I tried fixing it by turning off the iPhone and even deleted and reinstalled the app a couple of times but that didn't work, then. 

I next contacted the apps help line and got a message back that my problem would be passed on to their tech people.

Today I tried again to make a new entry on the iPhone app and it still froze so then I tried deleting the app and afterwards turning off my iPhone for five minutes.

When I reinstalled Day One app on my iPhone and waited till after it synced with icloud downloading all my past entries I again tried to make a new entry and this time it worked!

I  guess that the apps tech must have been working on it so my deleting the app and reinstalling it this time worked,  so if you have the same problem try it!

I have been using this app for years now and this is the first time I have had a problem with it so thanks!"

If using the pencil, entry will not scroll up and you are stuck trying to write in a very crunched space and trying not to hit pencil keys.

Unusable - I did contact support and they confirmed the issue.  Terrible development and QC for user interface.  This should have been addressed before release if they wanted to have customers using iPads."

I pay for premium and don’t know if I’d use it without all of the amazing features — I use it online for typing long updates but mostly I use the mobile app. I upload pictures, videos and voice recordings. I often dictate voice to text. I really like the ability to have multiple journals for different purposes. Does everything I need it to, and I feel a huge relief that I’m finally capturing the important details of life again.

UsefulReviewsNow,10764437988,2023-12-30T15:00:30-07:00,4,"The journaling concept is amazing. It meets all my needs and is by far the best free app of its kind. Unfortunately, there are a lot of drawbacks if you don’t choose the premium plan, which is roughly $36/year. For instance, if you don’t want to splurge on premium, you can not add videos or multiple photos into one entry. It is to be noted that you can add one photo per entry without premium. Also, there is no cross-device sharing without premium. You can’t start on your phone and end on your Mac unless you pay the price.

Overall, these don’t detract from an otherwise enjoyable journaling experience, but without premium, the line is thin between Day One and the standard Apple Notes app."

carrie3630,10759127176,2023-12-29T07:24:15-07:00,5,"I’ve been using DayOne for years and it just gets better and better. It is so easy to start a journal entry. DayOne is integrated across the iOS platform, so you can quickly send photos, articles, or inspiration from around the internet to your journal. The tagging and searching are top notch. You can even create separate journals for different projects or themes.

One of the best features is the location, weather, and activity logging that seamlessly integrate into new entries. When I’m out and about, I take a lot of pictures, but don’t always add them to DayOne the same day. When I create a new entry, I can add the photos and am immediately prompted to apply the photo date and location, so it keeps everything in order.

I love how the developer keeps making DayOne better. I know Apple has launched their own journalling app, but I’m committed to this wonderful app that has stood the test of time and is now a daily feature in my life."

Day One is a little different than Evernote, but just as useful.  I have almost 50 journals on various topics and time periods.  I use the app to keep track of my business and my nonprofit.  I take notes for the books I’m writing.  I use Day One to remember important things.  My entries often use pictures, videos, and audio files.  The whole thing is searchable.  It is my brain, stored on a handy device in my pocket.  For 2024, I plan to use Day One even more, recording notes and thoughts from almost every aspect of my life.  It is effortless to use.  I hope it remains just the way it is, for many years into the future.  One improvement I wouldn’t mind would be if the voice to text was a little more accurate sometimes.  It gets about 90% of the words right, and I can usually make the corrections pretty quickly.  I wish every app I use was this dependable, versatile, and useful."

I love writing, but I have always struggled with sitting down to write and getting overwhelmed while staring at a blank page. This app has a dictation feature which allows me to speak freely while the app transcribes it in real time. You can then go back and edit later. This is incredibly useful to me in the mornings, when most of my ideas hit me, but I have very little time to write them down because I’m getting ready for work. This app allows you to record and leave it running so you can simply talk at your device when you have something that you want to write down. There are many incredibly useful features in here, but the transcription is the one that wins the day for me. I highly recommend giving this app a try if you are a writer at heart, but struggle either with time or feeling overwhelmed in figuring out where to start."

Additionally, Day One offers simple markdown support, enabling me to format my entries exactly how I want them. 
The inclusion of daily prompts adds a creative touch, sparking inspiration for my journaling journey. I particularly appreciate the ""On this day"" pop-ups that remind me of my thoughts and experiences from a year ago, giving me a chance to reflect and appreciate my own growth.

ab2004,10715596599,2023-12-18T21:14:34-07:00,5,I love this app because it’s simple and easy to use. I also like that I’m able to connect via iCloud and have it sync across my Apple devices.

I downloaded this ages ago while looking for a good journal app, and of all of them, this had the cleanest layout and nicest location/time features - but the platform is so good that it has become essential to my creative process. Highly recommend!"

30nara,10712001898,2023-12-18T06:32:23-07:00,4,"Overall it's a great app. The only reason I'm giving it a 4-star rating is that it lacks support for right-to-left alignment, which makes it less suitable for writing in languages such as Persian."
JohnCorb,10704581356,2023-12-16T13:30:49-07:00,2,"Day one was once a great app . Been using it for many years and seen how it evolved. Its developers never listened to users and called us “vocal minority” when we asked for something THEY did not like. Removed all the great features from the app, photo stream was great once, now it’s no different from regular photo app, limited many features under subscription. Broke the book printing (our family bought a plan and tried 5 times to print the book - never worked, support couldn’t help). So it brings us to the present day with an app crippled by its own creator. Well, classic human story with its roots in the ancient scriptures."

A password recovery email was sent, I followed the link, and it would open up a Chrome tab directly to my account.

Which means that someone would merely need to have my email and request an account recovery and have direct access to my day one account on Chrome.

As an extension, the password recovery would do as I have outlined above and to change my password I wouldn’t have to reenter the password that I forgot.

Lastly, when I go to speak with customer support or “contact customer support I don’t actually get to contact anybody. I am directed to the FAQs or their forum, which to post, and I need to sign in."
DrBarr,10695673556,2023-12-14T20:17:45-07:00,5,I use this application daily. You can create different categories for each type of your entries. You can add photos to your entries. You can edit or delete your entries anytime you want. You can “Pin” to entries that you wanna be sure you won’t forget. I am so happy that I found this application! This application is perfect!!!??

waldhaus1,10694366952,2023-12-14T10:55:26-07:00,5,The other question is handwriting vs typing a journal entry. Day One if more focused on the typed entry. Taking time to be self aware and examining one’s life can always offer satisfaction - takes some of the immediacy out of life.

I tried the recent apple journal, but at this time, there’s no comparison. I suspect though, apple might iterate to the point where dayone might start need to worry, even the paid version of dayone. 

But right now, dayone is still my go to journaling and most likely everyone else as well."

Now they just made the previous app unusable and replaced it with this new one so that they could get more money. Original app you paid once and you were done. Now they try to make you pay a monthly fee for “premium” to get basically the same thing as what I already owned. They don’t even offer like a curtesy credit for the users who had paid for the previous app. They didn’t do any of this to benefit the consumer. They did it to get more money. Why would I pay for a monthly subscription to write like I can on the built in iPhone notes app?! Ridiculous

I’d suggest that Day One should migrate over to Android, but Google is probably working to copy Apple with their own Journal app."

Day One
iOS notes
Notebooks by Afons Schmid

I’ve whittled it down to two : 
 iOS Notes and Day One.

I’ve been using iOS notes for 15 years. I have used Day One in the past. But wasn’t satisfied with it. Then they did a super upgrade to it and it appears as though it’s a strong contender for the best Notes app. I’ve compared iOS notes with Day One feature by feature, capability by capability. So far Day One is  in the lead. But it’s close. I’ll post again when I’ve decided."
craignye,10682324970,2023-12-11T07:04:33-07:00,1,"Day One needs to separate tech issues which they won’t discuss with you unless you are a premium member, with book creation and billing which. Nobody needs to pay extra to talk to a company when they don’t or won’t fill out your order and take your money on top of it."
La Nikacia,10680633807,2023-12-10T19:21:51-07:00,1,"I got to the registration page and had the option of signing up with my Apple face recognition or email and password. My short term memory has been failing due to health issues which is why I wanted the app in the first place. 

Knowing that I’d inevitably randomly get signed out and get flustered and upset having to reset a password I wouldn’t remember, I chose to sign in with Apple. The app read my face and accepted it. Then…nothing. I could never get past that page even after the face scan recognized me every time. 

If just accessing the app doesn’t work correctly, how annoying is using it going to be? Deleting it right away. Disappointed, it looked fun and helpful."
SpiderKisses21,10674383659,2023-12-09T05:34:55-07:00,5,I would highly recommend this journal. You can have as many little journals as you want. I have one for each of my grand children one for recipes and one for what to do when I pass away. It is so easy to maneuver around and add photos.

My phone is always nearby and usually in my hands.  It is so easy to jot down some thoughts and feelings whenever they arise. 

I looked at several apps and deleted all except this one.  I use it on the simplest level.   It has tons of features, but they are not intrusive.  Just there if I want them.  

The typing practice on my phone is an added bonus."

Lalit Mishra,10651625209,2023-12-02T20:41:29-07:00,5,"Day One Journal App stands out as a premier digital journaling platform, providing a seamless and enriched experience for capturing life's moments. Its interface is elegantly simple, inviting users to document their thoughts and activities without the distraction of cluttered toolbars.

One of Day One's most compelling features is its versatility. Whether you're a minimalist who appreciates the one-click entry system and clean design or a detail-oriented person who enjoys cataloging entries with metadata like location, weather, and music, Day One caters to all. The app's use of templates and prompts ingeniously lowers the barrier to journaling, making it accessible even when inspiration is scarce.

For those who like to journal on-the-go, Day One's multimedia capabilities allow for a rich recording of experiences, enabling users to add photos, videos, and even audio to their entries. The app also respects the private nature of journaling, offering robust security features to protect personal musings.

Customizable reminders are another innovative aspect, helping users build a consistent journaling habit by setting multiple prompts throughout the day, tailored to their schedule.

In essence, Day One excels not just as a digital journal but as a companion for life's journey, providing a versatile, secure, and user-friendly space to document personal growth, reflect on experiences, and store memories."

Lea Franco,10639849122,2023-11-29T15:30:37-07:00,5,"The over under:
Making a habit of using Day One has saved me time, lowered my anxiety, and saved me money. 
It’s worth the subscription. Get it. 

The longer version that ADHDers in particular will see themselves in and understand:

Losing time finding things, buying things you think will fix you but you never use, buying another of the thing you can’t find or forgot you already have, is the “ADHD Tax.” I’ve paid. 
(I personally consider losing writing, ideas, and pictures part of the ADHD tax.)  

Day One  is the first app (or physical book) I’ve ever used regularly. I did have to build the habit, but it wasn’t hard because Day One is effortless. 

I have many lovely journals. a couple bujos, planners, and the guilt from not using them. 
I used to have a lot of stuff “somewhere” and had to go on a safari every time I needed any of it. 

I use Day One for journaling, saving ideas for projects, corralling spicy social media drafts and angry emails safely away from that “send” button, cataloging stuff in bins, boxes, and baskets, venting, pet pictures, and checklisting.  
It’s a boss feeling when you think, “Where is the (insert thing  here)?” and I can look it up, see it’s in Bin 3, grab it, and get back to what I was doing. 
Day One has tagging so it’s even easier to find that #blue faux fur or tell yourself #Go Me. 

My one and only beef  is that Day One is a subscription instead of a purchase. I’d love a version I could buy and set to back up to Dropbox or my personal cloud storage. 
On the other hand, this year’s cost of using Day One is definitely less than an unused planner and replacing a jacket."

I have it on both my iPhone and iPad; I'm comfortable with the features and functionality and it syncs well with both devices. I'd be much more consistent in journaling if I was just able to access it through the internet with a desktop. I type much more fluently on a regular keyboard and using the devices forces me to type with one finger.

The prompts are genuine as well and they blend well with normal journal entries.  I truly love this."

sterlingts,10550151365,2023-11-04T11:52:11-07:00,5,"This app is EVERYTHING I need in a journaling app, and so much more! I’ve always been a pen to paper kind of journalist. One day I was sitting by a small river, with 3 different notebooks. As I was writing, I slipped a little bit on a rock, and almost dropped my notebook. I thought to my self, if I were to drop this notebook in the water, I’d lose everything in here. That made me think, maybe it’s time to go digital. At least it would all be backed up. I’ll fast forward a bit~ I tried several different apps, and I landed here. This app allows me to have everything in one place, it allows me to add pictures, songs, and really anything! It plays seamlessly between my computer, and phone (I pad if I wanted) and the convenience is incredible. It tracks where I made the entry, and the time (I’ve always had an interesting fascination with starting my entries with the date and exact time I’m journaling because I feel it captures the moment in it’s entirety. I’m writing this review at 11:37AM). It even captures the weather, which I suppose isn’t important (to me) but a fun detail. Ok, I’m trailing here~ this app is amazing, and I suggest you find out the features for yourself! I’m a daily journalist and this app lets me categorize everything exactly as I need it. I can search, and reference things as needed. I couldn’t possibly be more happy with an app! Everything is backed up, twice, and you can get your journals printed if you want them on the shelf! I haven’t used this feature yet, but I know the time will come. I do miss the tactile feel of writing on paper, but for what this app offers, the pros heavily outweigh the cons!!!!! At times when paper is what’s available,  I find my self taking a picture of the entry and logging it into the app. HERE’S YOUR SIGN, MAKE THE SWITCH. I can, nearly, guarantee you won’t regret it! I like that i have the option to password lock the app, because this is for me, and only me. I could go on, and on, but I’ll end this here. THIS IS THE ONLY APP I HAVE THAT I CAN SAY HAS TRULY CHANGED MY LIFE. For how much I journal, and what this app offers, I will gladly pay the subscription price :) JUST DO IT!"

Day One is the place where everything comes together - all links (music, video, pdf, photos) bookmarks, accounting, reading, recipes, journaling. Give it a spin and find a central repository with security options for everything - an uncluttered running diary of life so you can get back to living it. Free up brain space for creative, enjoyable endeavors rather than searching for stored info across too many platforms. The tagging and multiple journal capabilities are the key to your freedom.

Update: a great app to store Freeform boards as pdfs.  

Syncing is seamless across the Apple ecosystem and love making audio notes and journals which can be AI transcribed."

Basic level no longer allows addition of a photo. With basic you can add a photo to an entry which has worked for me for as long as I have used the app (almost 8 years). The latest version of the app asks you to sign up for premium when you try to add the photo. Help pages are useless as you have to sign up for a Wordpress domain to use the forums. And then you can’t log in that way either. No way to contact support other than a chatbot which asks you, again, to sign up for premium. I really like this app but this is a step backwards."

kasia4484,10458147038,2023-10-09T23:24:27-07:00,4,"Improvement in Handwriting Experience

Rating: ????? (4/5)

I've been using the Day One app for some time now, and I must say, I'm a huge fan. It's an excellent tool for digital journaling, offering a plethora of features that make it stand out. The seamless integration with various media types, robust tagging system, and intuitive interface are all top-notch.

However, there's one area where I find room for improvement—the Apple Pencil experience. As someone who enjoys a more handwritten journaling approach, I was hoping for a smoother and more immersive experience. Currently, the app allows for drawing and basic writing, but it doesn't quite capture the essence of a true handwritten journaling experience.

I believe that a substantial update in this aspect would be a game-changer. If the app could enhance the handwriting capabilities to provide a more natural and fluid writing experience, it would undoubtedly elevate the Day One app to a whole new level.

While I started with the one-month free trial, I have reservations about extending it and purchasing the upgrade, primarily due to this reason. However, I'd be more than willing to become a loyal, long-term client if this particular feature is addressed in future updates.

In summary, the Day One app is fantastic, but there's a potential for perfection in the handwriting department. With some tweaks and updates, this app could easily become a five-star favorite for many, including myself.

Kasia"

DrFunk,10448471716,2023-10-07T05:29:34-07:00,5,"I saw a video where a photographer was taking two seconds out of each day for a whole year and put it together in a few minutes of a movie. The images went flashing by in high speed, but your minds eye could capture the moment, and it was a memory brought forward. Fascinating how a short  movie was able to remind you of the whole year. I was all excited and thought I needed to do this however, that’s a lot of editing! So I found this app and decided that using the dictation system on the iPhone, and this app, I would start to record, the salient features of each day. I felt like life is going by too fast so I needed to record it. That was in 2019. Boy was I right because since then we’ve had multiple years of Covid, death in the family, issues at work and a national awards that my daughter got, all recorded in it in this app. After losing my wife, I’m so glad I have images and jokes and things to remember her by. I started recording 4 years before her death and now wish I had done this at the beginning. The app works flawlessly and I will continue to do so. I record a little something and some photo of each day. The stuff I want to remember and even the stuff I want to forget because I don’t wanna do that again! I finally printed out five books by now, so I have them on paper on my shelf. Time is your most valuable asset and we don’t record the events very well, thinking that will remember it all. Looking back at the books I can tell you those books are priceless. Thank you Day One."

I journal when it feels right. When I’m happy, when I’m sad, when I wake up from a confusing dream. It allows me the freedom to express myself when it need it most.

Also, I have two phones and they sync instantly and with full accuracy. That means it doesn’t matter what phone I have with me, or is nearest to me, I’m always up to date. 5 stars."
KatWalk65,10421441594,2023-09-29T18:15:37-07:00,5,"For a long time, I resisted this app because I already use Evernote, drafts, bear and too many archives of paper journals to want another journal. This deliberate chronicle, albeit digital, has its own set of new nightmares (e.g. losing brilliant drafts never to be recovered in this lifetime; 99 CENT pay wall hitting at that critical juncture where poverty and verisimilitude collide to disrupt the latest masterpiece with a Mephisto phenomenon option: or else!)

 I like the interface, platform, obvious intention & execution of this app. The ""interface"" to me means how I interact with the digital input of my thoughts and artist way type Journaling that I've been doing doe twenty odd years - so I want to pick up where I left off not have to adjust my creative process to some fraudulent fad, but rather seamlessly fold the ""platform"" which in this case is iphone app into my creative process. Which to some might be ""crazy"" or chaotic because I am highly creative. I don't want an application limiting the expression I have been honing over my 58 years on the planet. I appreciate the fluid format and ability to play with media within a post, love the fonts and am generally a huge fan. I went from premium at first to standard due to massive cuts in cash flow so all paid apps had to go until I could justify their value. I forsee at some point paying premium to complete an archive or print a thematic book. As a lifelong writer and photographer, a writer, Director and producer by trade and a storytelling maven by fate, I love this app and encourage writers or artist way type journal afficionadoes (those who use photorealism to convey their thoughts and emotions or visual poetry) out there to give it a try. It's pretty integrated so you can track your life archive across multiple tools and resources you already find useful in your digital dominion. I welcome the developers to set up.a forum for their loyal users to give more meaningful feedback. I'm genx and prefer contributing to projects that can best utilize my time investment. Cheers!

The best parts: it reminds me of journal entries I made on this date years ago; the export to PDF function; the ability to get a printed book of my entries (great quality, I use it often).

I write on my iPad quite a bit and love to use slide-over and split-screen views to jot down thoughts in my journal while I am reading my Kindle book in the background. Hard to believe that Day One still craps out once you hit one full page of content within the app. Once you finish writing a full-page in slide-over or split-screen view, you can no longer see what you are writing because the app stops scrolling with your writing. You are writing “blind” so to speak. It is really hard to believe that this problem still persists after all these years and has frustrated me on more than one occasion.

Things might be a bit buggy and wonky while we all try to adapt to this new layout, but I’m sure those other things will be taken care of in time.

 I’ve been searching around for another journal app to use and nothing still comes close to DayOne. In my opinion, this is still the best journaling app out there and as long as they don’t continue to change things that make the app less user friendly and away from the original intentions of the app, I’m still willing to stick with them. 

Even when they do big updates like these that kind of has everyone mad about the change. As long as I try to get used to the change, then I think I will feel better about it later on."
venusamaris,11352062949,2024-06-06T19:04:40-07:00,3,"Updated to add: I do not love this new version. I have been using this app for years now. I always like the touches of color on the screen. Now they have stripped away nearly all the color. Why? It is so sterile and boring, and I honestly do not see the reason for the change. Were people complaining that it was too colorful. I kind of doubt that. Change for the sake of change is always a bad idea. Nothing about this latest update has improved my experience in using it. Learn to leave a good thing alone instead of messing it up in pursuit of a “fresh new look”.

Updated to add: I love the new location function in the latest update, it was just what I was hoping for. The developers are obviously trying hard to be responsive to users. They did not ""abandon iCloud"" here or charge money for an update. This is a NEW VERSION of Day One, and if you want to use it you will have to pay all of $5 - $10 (!), and learn to live with their excellent sync service. If you love the classic Day One, keep using it. It is not going away, or being abandoned. If you want iCloud sync, stick with the Classic version, do not expect this version to meet that need. The developers have done everything possible to communicate the fact that iCloud and Dropbox would not be available in v2, and why. It makes sense to me, and if I really want to keep using iCloud sync I can stick with Day One Classic. I recommend going to the developer website and reading their blog post from a week or so ago, which outlines why the changes and what they see as the benefit of using Day One Sync instead of iCloud. I have used Day One for a few years now, and I have always loved it. Journaling is very important in my life, I have done it since I was a kid and I have boxes of paper journals archived away. The original Day One was my go-to journal from the first day I downloaded it. I was a bit worried about the impending upgrade, I tip my hat to the developers of Day One for doing it right."

I’m typing some pretty emotional stuff and for whatever reason, I guess a slight movement of my phone, the app tries to go in landscape mode and just shows a completely jacked up display (unusable or distinguishable screen the app is displaying since it glitched out trying to switch the orientation). Nothing makes it go back to normal so I close the app completely and open it back up. And just like that the last few minutes of writing are gone. That might not seem like a big deal but when you’re just pouring into something, it’s coming from the heart, you’re not thinking about remembering what you just typed. Why would you even make the app to do that? How is that even possible? Does your app just “save” every couple minutes? Even something as simple as the Notes app that comes with the phone has never done that - once you type it it’s there regardless of when or how quick you close the app. So right there I just didn’t like the experience and am going to look for another app. Completely throws off the experience and now you can’t even trust the app to do the most basic of things - save what you wrote."

Also, I have to click in twice to see the “on this day tab” when I’d much prefer it to be fixed above my entries.

Been using Day One Premium for years as a very satisfied (paying) customer.

That said, I have to echo many others. The new UI is absolutely awful. The new “book” view requires extra clicks to get to stats that used to be at the top of the list view. It is a waste of space and is completely unnecessary.

There was no problem with the previous UI and this feels like change for the sake of change to try to give the perception of “staying fresh”. As a software developer myself, this is one of the worst things I see other developers do.

After years of paying for Day One, I genuinely find myself considering finding an alternative. Rather than responding with “we are here to help you through the changes”, PLEASE listen to your customers and bring back the previous UI. I don’t need your “help”. I have figured out how to use the new UI and have quickly concluded that I hate it."
RevanRem,11344614904,2024-06-04T20:01:04-07:00,1,"Latest update crashes the app when a journal is open and switches from portrait to landscape mode and then back to portrait.  Keyboard stays in landscape and minimizing and reopening the app doesn’t fix the issue and crashes.

I have to close the app entirely and reopen and keep the app in portrait only to prevent crashing during note taking.

Overall despite this love the app and have for many years. I assume the problem will eventually be resolved but will give a one star to draw attention to issue."
heykellies,11344489346,2024-06-04T19:08:07-07:00,3,"I love DayOne and have used it since 2013. What was wrong with the old layout? Now it’s cramped up to the top and much less informative at a glance. I liked being able to see the numbers, like where my streak is at, without having to tap to open another menu, and it was much more visually appealing when there was some room to breathe at the top. Would be nice to have the option to go back to the previous layout. There doesn’t seem to be any value add to this new change in looks."

Then they respond to the complaint saying “we know adapting to change is hard”. Do not gaslight me. I have used this app for four years and I loved it. You need some customer service training. Do not trust these people to have any continuation of product. A journal app is a personal investment. They broke trust."

Recently though, I noticed a glitch where my journal entry lists are highlighted in the very unattractive yellow color at times, even though those were not highlighted by me, nor do they look highlighted when I open the individual entry. 

I also really miss the color bar at the top of each journal entry, so that you could see the journal in which you were writing. Now all individual entries look the same, regardless of which journal you are using so easy to mistake one journal for another. Can you please bring back the style, prior to the update, and can you please give us a prettier color to highlight with, such as a light yellow, green, pink, or blue, instead of mustard yellow?"

Kevin 72638393,11340246942,2024-06-03T15:16:38-07:00,1,"May 2024 UPDATE: They decided to totally change the UI. Yet again. It looks nothing like the award winning app of old, and they’re removing functionality (like you can’t see your sync status on the home screen anymore - arguably one of the most important functions of the app). The decline continues. I’m preparing to go to another journal service soon. I had high hopes but it’s clear Automatic is drastically changing things. This isn’t the Day One we all knew and loved. ANOTHER UPDATE: April 2024. Syncing is now a disaster. I’ve been down on multiple devices and despite half a dozen emails and tons of log files, support has no idea. What happened to you, Day One ?!?! Curse you, Automatic Inc, for the decline of what was once a shining example of a customer focused app with rock solid support. You are hastening people’s move off the platform. I WANT to use the app but every month there’s a new issue. Bugs are popping up all over. UPDATED AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE, 8/16/23: Nope, they're actually wrong. I'm a developer myself - you have a bug in your app. The exact commands referenced puts you in the same looped workflow of documentation and never opens the email client. And the revamped timeline still looks awful. I'm looking at alternative journal solutions - like Apple Journal or Bear Notes. Day One has gone backwards. UPDATED 8/1/23: They are making changes, and not for the better. Dropped from 3 stars to 2. They totally borked the time line view now - increasing the front size and adding useless data, so now you can only see like 3-4 entries at a time with lots of wasted space. Journal apps don't need constant UI changes. In fact - it's a problem. Journaling is a routine oriented task - and millions have adopted the Day One workflow. Changing it for no tangible benefit is crazy, and has me looking at Bear Notes and other alternatives. Who is driving these feature changes over there? It's getting worse... Oh - and despite being a premium user - you actually cannot contact support anymore! Their own documentation directs you to an area of the app that seems changed - it just redirects to old, outdated documentation instead of directing to an email message client. Yikes. If you are considering Day One as a newbie, consider something else. This app is not the clear winner it used to be. Fixes no one asked for, while user-favorite features (cough cough web app) are in perpetual Beta. OLD Review: The iOS app is great, but the application itself is severely lacking due to the recent, quiet, abandonment of their web browser app. They were working on it, and there was a highly anticipated beta - but it’s been shutdown and abandoned (they say temporarily, but it doesn’t look like it - they wouldn’t shut access down entirely if really temporary). There is currently no way to access any part of your journal on a windows desktop browser. So - the app is good, but it’s tedious in daily life as you can’t easily get items from your desktop into your journal."

It’s led to a frustrating journaling experience that is supposed to be an enjoyable and calming part of my day. I reached out to support and got an AI chat bot response. I will likely be canceling my subscription to this app and looking for another app from a different developer. Sad and frustrated since this app was awesome before they decided to change it."
antevante08,11333758892,2024-06-01T22:37:40-07:00,1,Switching between portrait and landscape typing crashes the app. The new layout has less information and is buggy overall. It doesn’t save what you type anymore either. Hoping this is just temporary.

Design is a matter of taste. I don’t like it but perhaps other will love it. But some of the design decisions seems at least strange - who needs the book tab under which there is almost nothing actionable. 

But lack of functionality and plenty of bugs is unforgivable. Who needs the calendar when there is no opportunity to move fast to other date. Search is not working correctly. 

I don’t understand who decided to deploy ugly, not properly tested app. 

Very sad :(."

I had previously given Day One a one star due to the fact the app was frozen. Several days the app icon was overlaid with the download progress widget and it would not open. It was also frozen on the App Store. The open option on the store did not work.  That problem was resolved by deleting the app through iPhone settings. That allowed the App Store to download a new copy of the app.

Since my encryption key was saved in the iCloud, the new download works great and all my journal entries are intact.

I give it 5 stars for now."

I have at least a dozen journals and use half of them regularly. I keep a diary, a work journal, and a health journal among others. I don’t use the text or email entry features, I find it easy enough to open the app and tap the journal I need. 

There are so many more ways I could be using this app, but I am satisfied with the basic functionality of journal access on the fly. I have had reminders set up for morning and evening, but I find that I just ignore them. I love this app most for jotting down in the moment thoughts and feelings, unloading after a hard day at work, drafting letters and memos, capturing career/work ideas, snapping pics of meaningful moments on hikes, and as a place to record  health information (I snap pics of after-visit notes from doctors).

However, I’d like to see them continue to improve it, even if they label it Advanced or Super Premium… and have to charge more.

I’d like to see a LOT more formatting and editing features.  I’d like to see advanced notation abilities.  

I’d like to see a Grammarly based system for auto grammar, spelling and punctuation.  

I’d like to see a suite of dictionaries that cover synonyms, Thesaurus, other languages… and an easy way to call up the one the user needs.

I’d like to see the Underline come back.  

I’d like to see an array of user chosen highlighters from a color wheel.

The book mark is great, and the ability to word search is very good, but I’d like the ability to narrow down the word/quote search in a more refined way.  I usually forget the word that I want to recall.  I also ask myself something like, “When did I write about such and such?” and don’t remember a single descriptive thing about the entry.

The bottom like is that I will stick with Day One even if it never changes, but advancing Day One is something that I would be very excited about.   Also, the Staff is way above and beyond any other of my 300 other apps."

I believe that there is a lot of areas that can be addressed when journaling and so far, Day One has nailed all areas. It is an amazing program and though it has only been 5 days. I do feel as though this will be something I stick with. I typically use journaling to get through issues or concerns, and sometimes huge emotional challenges. Once I write them out I tend to stop journaling, but with Day On, I feel that the templates for added discussions as well as the daily question or prompt, will help me stay a head of the emotional black hole I end up in."

I use it for regular journal.
I have 17 chronic diseases and I use it as a daily symptom tracker. 
**Here’s where the app could improve: I have created a few symbols which I saved to my photo library. Example, one is a bright lightening bolt for bad neuropathy days. Unfortunately, because I have already used this photograph on the day it was created, DAY ONE won’t permit me to use it multiple times so I can see it as the main image on the calendar. 
I want to see these symbols I have created so when I visit with one of my physicians, I am able to pull up the calendar to see how often I was having symptoms for a particular disease. 
Perhaps Day One could create actual symbols / sticker / feelings face, to add to actual calendar… for example if I was glancing at the month, even though there is a photograph of my dog, I could add a symbol to acknowledge something medical related. 
A ""+"" symbol on each day of the calendar would allow a person to add a necessary symbol (pretty much almost any emoji that is currently available on the keyboard would suffice). 
Users need a way to put something visible on the view of the monthly calendar so they can refer back to a specific day and not have to search through every entry to find what they were looking at. 
One symbol I made is ""HEALTH UPDATE"" it’s purple and turquoise. It takes the place of a personal photograph. However, because I created it January 3, 2024… Day One says I already used that photograph and I am not able to override it and use it again and again anytime I choose. 
*App should permit people to freely use the same photo as often as they choose… it’s their choice!
Otherwise… love the app!"

I get a message saying “there is a later version” but this so-called later version is actually the partial entry. The later part completely disappears, it’s not even visible in the cloud. So I have several paragraphs that no longer exist. I do not appreciate losing my writing, especially when I can’t get a message to the company about what is happening.

Love the ability to embed media, metadata and tags. Really appreciate that you can export things as PDF based on various factors or just the entire thing. (I haven’t used their print service, but it’s on my mind!) I also like that you can back date entries so they fall in the right place chronologically. The longer I use it (several years now) the more I discover."

Ahhh yes I get it now. Let’s forget about all the original investors in your app and move along to the bloated subscription model. HARD PASS I see. I get it now. Classic. Premium. Nouveaux. Whatever you want to call it. We who bought your app from the early days. The ones who bought it SEPARATELY FOR ALL iOS iPad AND MACOS devices can now move along. Nothing to see here. Just call it whatever you want but no way is a subscription model worth anything when Apple has a perfectly great substitute NON SUBSCRIPTION ALTERNATIVE in the app store. You guys are all the same. Stop updating apps for those who were with you from the jump. Who overpaid from the jump because we believed in you. Wanted you to grow and succeed. Now its all cherry eyed happiness oh sorry no more updates we don’t need or want your support anymore. Just like Notability and all the rest. Good riddance. I will take my business elsewhere You don’t update or add features at hardly the rate to justify an annual subscription nor do you provide security for our personal journals. More of the money grubbing same."

I was looking for an app that would help me document my journey into the crafting world - saving photos, learning techniques etc.  but I soon was using it for documenting nearly everything in my life.  From being able to have multiple journals, to tags, and the ability to access my journals on all the platforms I use (iOS, Mac, Windows) - this app hits every checkmark for what I wanted in a journal, and more!  

I recently had to contact support for help with an issue, and immediately got a response (AI assistant), and when my issue was more complicated (so I thought), got an immediate response from one of their ""Happiness Engineers"".  That made me smile twice: first on reading it, and second because the help I got really made me happy!  (As it turned out - it wasn't anything with DayOne app, it was user error, but the Support folks were amazing in helping me understand what happened!)

Highly recommend this app!"

The option to change the color of my highlighted text. Why is yellow the only color?  Also, it would be nice to hide journals that you are not currently using. Its frustrating that I have to see all of the journals that are not relevant to me now. I don’t want to delete them just hid them."

From the way I plan my day. To the way I have learned to navigate my thoughts with more precision. It’s a must have. From the customization by colors of journals. To the sharing across devices. DayOne has effortlessly reawakened my love for writing. It’s a 5 star app. From a free user. I would love to see what a paid subscription could bring. I test the Beta and it’s def worth the money. Take the offer right away if you are presented with it. Don’t wait and miss out on the benefits it brings.

Some of the things that I love about the app include pre-populated templates to begin your journaling.  If you have never journaled, this makes it easy to get started because you don’t have to think about what to write about.  If you are more seasoned and/or you know how and what you want to write about each day, you can easily build a custom template and begin with the same template each day.  
I love being able to add pictures to the journal as well.  There are several ways you can use this, but I prefer to add any pictures from the to day to my daily journal entry.  Some of the other features include being able to add or include other types of media to your entry.  Although I personally do not use this feature, it is cool to know its there. I also appreciate the timeline feature of the app.  This allows you to go back and see previous days, months and years.  It also allow a streak building for your journaling habit.  Highly recommend.

48th Parallel,11109778640,2024-04-01T07:19:30-07:00,5,"I don’t know that this review is worth much as I have never used any other digital journal but for my many purposes, Day One is perfect.  I liked it so much I purchased another subscription for my spouse but she still prefers a paper journal with her fountain pen.  And here’s where the huge differences between the two forms really shows up.  When she wants to find the date when something happened, it’s a laborious search.  I just type the event or name or place into the search feature and I get all the hits, the most recent entry first.  With Day One I can add photos, video links, emails, texts, or even parts of daily newsletters I get as instantly as a 72 year old man can do anything instantly.  I have separate journals for books bought, borrowed, and read, for projects I’m working on, and for travelogues.  For my spouse to do any of those things is nye impossible in a paper journal just from a space standpoint.  And if I too want the feel and flow of ink on paper, which I often do, I do just that and take a photo to enter on my digital journal.
	But it’s when you’ve been at Day One for awhile that some of it’s marvelous features begin to show up.  The “On This Day” feature is a treat.  For instance, today it shows that I have four entries for today.  To click on that and discover anew what I was doing three, four, five years ago today is, in addition to being fun and informative, a daily jolt regarding the passage of time.
	Two other features I love about Day One is that it syncs my journal across all my devices.  I can jot down an entry on my phone when I’m waiting in line at the car wash or having lunch in a diner.  I can check on an entry from last year when I’m on the go.  The other thing I prize is the privacy.  My Day One is password protected which allows me to be a little more free with personal details than I otherwise would be.
	Does Day One have some warts.  I’ve yet to meet an app that doesn’t but, again, for my needs this things I would like different are so few that I haven’t even bothered mentioning them to management.  I hope I’ve made it clear why I think this app deserves five stars."

I would have if it offered features I couldn’t live without, but it doesn’t, so why spend the money unnecessarily? I’ve rated this app two stars because the journal is good, even if buggy at times. I couldn’t go more than two stars because I don’t think it’s right that they reserve live support for subscriptions only. I paid money for your apps and should be able to get support when needed. I can see giving subscription members priority support and making others wait longer, but to not offer live support to those that have supported and purchased your products before subscriptions were even a thing is just wrong. If a subscription offered me something I needed, I’d buy it, but I don’t need to add more than ten photos or videos to my entries. And I certainly won’t pay just to get support. In fact, that alone is reason enough to never buy the subscription. You might as well call your subscription a support plan, not a subscription."

I first got so annoyed that I started to reverse my order of journal entries so that the first thing I could do when I opened Word was write my newest journal entry! It eventually got so messy and long though, so then I thought, “there’s GOT to be something else out there!!!

I’m currently using Day One’s free premium trial, and it’s so great that I wish so so badly I could make my own money bc if I did, I would TOTALLY pay for a subscription immediately!!! Too bad I only have so long until my trial ends... ??"
YourRegGrlGamer,11096709454,2024-03-28T17:30:00-07:00,5,The recording of your life will become invaluable later in life. This app’s feature makes it easy to do that. The ability to sync between devices is a win over apples basic journal app.
Pitachip296,11095520447,2024-03-28T09:46:56-07:00,5,This is the best digital journal app I’ve found I love being able to see what days I’ve journaled and it’s a great way to try to journal every day!

They gave me an email (through the app) but the automatic generated email, send you back to App Store or the bot.  You will get NO WHERE trying to stop this subscription.  If you purchase this, and lose your appleid and apple can’t seem to help you w/ that either (that’s another story) …  be prepared to pay for this app for the rest of your life or until your cc expires."

I was so excited to use the new and improved version; however, it is constantly (and by constantly, I mean with each and every use) crashing. No matter what I try to do (write a new entry, look at historical entries etc) or where I try to do it (iPhone vs iPad), the app freezes, and the only way to fix the issue is to close the app and go back in. Further, even when I am typing on the new app, there is a big lag in the words. Please please please fix this. This app would be perfect if only it didn't freeze all the time!"

I love it!
It is easy to keep track of my life and look back over the years to see how far I’ve come.
10/10 recommend and I often give a subscription of this as a gift to family and friends."
Yogiini Carolyn,11085342173,2024-03-25T14:29:26-07:00,5,"I keep about 12 sub journals concurrently with salient topics.  It has become a lifesaver for me as well as an easy way to check on a particular subject.

When I suffered with serious digestive issues, I started one titled Gastrointestinal.  Appointments with my gastroenterologist were very disappointing because he would say, “No coffee.”  Then when I read his notes concerning our office visits he would reiterate that the colonoscopies were unremarkable but I was described as labile.
     That really made me angry.  Of course I’m labile, if you were going through what I’m dealing with you would be labile, too!   I was actually contemplating how I could leave this plant without it looking like suicide.  It was that bad. 
     I thought, “OK, Buddy, you are about to get some journal entries.”  I copied about four horrendous days of entries and gave them to the receptionist for him to read before my next appointment.  They became part of my health record so they couldn’t be ignored.  
    Outcome:  he ordered an upper GI, lower GI and stool sample.  At last I was heard.  Result:  no pancreatic digestive enzymes and I needed supplementation.  I was normal at last after years of agony.
     If you have a chronic condition and are being gaslighted, I urge you to keep a journal on the symptoms and and how they are impacting your life.  Tell your story and be honest and graphic.  Dates and times and related events are important and helpful for diagnosis."

cpoetree,11081634725,2024-03-24T13:44:56-07:00,5,"Day One provides space and encouragement for more than a memoir, a diary or a daily journal.

With a provocative prompt for each day and the possibility to include images, it offers space for musing and personalizing life as we live it.

It is beautifully formatted, allowing search, dating and recall to happen easily.  Also, when one runs into a snag (and I have) help is readily available.  I have found it to be clear and effective.

If I could afford it, I would readily choose to update my Day One to premium.  Although I cannot, using Day One on a primary level is a delight this daily user would not miss.

Day One helps me grow!  Thank you to those who created it, maintain it and update it!  I'm beyond grateful."

With that, I purchased the premium, and since have experienced numerous quirks which have caused me to alter my opinion.

Far too frequently I have received “are you happy with your experience?” pop ups as I’m trying to utilize the app which appear in inconvenient locations (like over something I’m reading or trying to write)..and if that was annoying enough,..they have seldom worked, or went away, literally blocking my screen!!

Other times,..things I’ve clicked on direct to other places on the app I was not intending to see!

I would not be concerned about any of this had I not paid!

So unless they correct these bugs soon, I’ll be cancelling my subscription and would greatly warn anyone from paying for the premium package."

I tell people about it all the time because I have nothing but good things to say. There are so many features that I love about it! Just so incredibly well designed. I saw that Apple came out with a Journaling app but it doesn’t even come close to how perfectly developed this app is. 10 stars for me.

I try and I try but never manage to make it longer than a few weeks before I’ve given up on writing. Day One was recommended by a guest on The Tim Ferriss Show, so I decided to check it out. I’ve never loved something so much in my life. Writing has become part of my daily routine. The journal categories allow you to compartmentalize so many things and the fact that you can make notes on your phone to deep dive into later on the PC is just phenomenal. I can take create an entry while walking at the park and make quick notes of a podcast I’m listening to, then recall and complete the whole idea when I get home. If thoughts start creeping in while laying bed and I’m having difficulty falling asleep, again I can make a quick entry to dump the idea from my brain, and sleep comfortably knowing I can address the next morning on the pc. There’s just so much utility with this app. I love it. If I ever become a famous writer, this will be mentioned as one of my favorite and most valuable purchases of all time."

Don’t use many of the very advanced features, because it’s main function as a journal works so well. Records where you were, the weather and so much more automatically. I keep one journal for each car, and a Journal of “things” where I photo any warrenty item with the receipt. Has come in very handy! Do miss the widget that showed how many words you entered over the last 50 days, great for finding days you only started an entry."

I didn’t need to read any reviews! I started using it last year and I fell in love although I wish we could add more photos, I understand I have to pay but other that that it’s totally worth getting! I love this app. Especially when I’m out and need to write and don’t have my journal with me this helps me so much!

Here are the things I really like about Day One -

— can use across all my devices with ease
— I am able to copy, forward and even create PDFs of my entries when needed - this was a big let down with the apple journal app… I started using that until I realized that you cannot copy or export anything once it is in their app. 
— picture tagging - love that the app automatically goes to the pictures with the same date(s) as the journal entry.  Makes it so simple.
— hashtag capability - makes this easy to organize my journal in a way my mind works
—automatically imports instagram posts (now, we just need it to do the same for facebook - that’s where I posted a lot of my stuff before) 

Enhancements I would like to see:
—facebook post integration
—bible app integration would be AMAZING"

Apple’s new Journal app doesn’t have a recurring cost, and hesitant to pay a recurring price for an app that I can’t keep fully unlocked long term.  I have apps that I have purchased from 2009 still kicking just fine without monthly or yearly subscription fees."

This app makes it possible for my private thought to be kept just that Private. I’m able to add pictures and if I forget to log in I get a reminders.

However last week I was scammed and lost access to my Apple ID. The scammers locked me out of it. I had to get a new id. I wrote to the support email explaining the situation and got back a template email with links to their FAQs- and said they only give individual support to those who pay. You call that good customer service? I don’t. I won’t be using their app again. I heard from the developer but I am still not satisfied. In fact, I am very angry. Any link you provide to offer help is a link to the help page. Option 1 is the Help guides which are links to articles and tutorials. Option 2 is the DayOne forum, but In order to write to the forum you must have an account on Wordpress-something I don’t care to have- even if the first year is free. The only other option on the page is for premium users, of which I was one but cannot use it because I lost the use of my AppleID. As I said above, I won’t be back. I found another solution for my needs. Have a nice life!"

I tried to write customer service but they told me I am not a premium user I am a free user so there’s not much help for me.

This broke a habit I had fought hard to pick up. I had brainstorming going on in some of those 144 entries—story ideas I wanted to revisit and expand on. They’re long gone now, and I’m just now getting over the anger, frustration, and sadness of all my lost material.

While I appreciate the ability for friends to comment on my journal entries, it would be immensely helpful if they could also co-edit them.

Adding the option for friends to edit entries would greatly enhance our ability to work on the journal together. Thank you for considering this feature addition!"

It has an option if you want notifications or not and doesn’t just automatically send them to you. I can unwind my day before I go to sleep and it’s the best way to do that! It also improves your typing and grammar but you don’t even work at it, you just get on the habit over time.

Switching to Diarium from here on out - it has just about everything Day One has, doesn’t require a subscription (only a one time fee for the same features Day One subscription-walls), plus it’s not run by people who gladly house transphobes and other bigots on their social media platforms."

This journal does! It shows you a year in review. I haven’t made it yet, but I’m happy to know that it’ll show me what I’ve done in previous years on the same day. A great journal! So easy to use."
houstonbruce,10952701238,2024-02-18T06:20:18-07:00,5,"UPDATE: February 2024
I really enjoy Day One. They make it convenient to journal. I also have a text reminder that reminds me, daily, to write. It is so convenient to do this, and often, I copy and paste messages I have written others, into my journaling process. Why write things twice.

One feature I want to explore more of is family journaling, but I am not sure my family would want to do this. 

Templates make things easier if you have repetitive forms of journaling in mind. 

UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2023 I do not really have any complaints with this app. It does what it says, and I feel that my data and personal information is reasonably-secure. I like being able to text my entries. Helpful if I have already written something I want to document that I have written to family or friends via text message. That was a feature I really liked—the ability the app had to ask if I wanted to open the application after using iOS Share Sheet to post a journal entry. If it went away, please bring it back. It is super-helpful to have the option to click and just go directly into the app."
DayOneMike,10950625040,2024-02-17T16:42:01-07:00,5,"I have been using Day One for the past 80 days and absolutely enjoy the experience with this app.
It gives me a chance to reflect on each day and reminds me of the good things and experiences in my life.  The ability to add photos and memories is fantastic.
As I said it’s been 80 days since I started journaling and look forward to years as this is a great way to diary and reflect on your life experiences."
McCarthyAero,10948782130,2024-02-17T05:49:27-07:00,3,"I like the format for the most part. For some reason - perhaps a bug - entry’s will not record. The process goes like this. Hit the “plus” to begin the entry, type, perhaps a few photos. Hit “done” - poof! Gone. The entry is not saved. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. Frustrating."
OnHD,10938132431,2024-02-14T07:11:49-07:00,1,"I’m a PLUS legacy user. I find their weather service is in accurate and I don’t want my historical journal entries to be incorrect. That seems incompatible with why one journals to begin with. I’ve asked Support if I can disable the weather service entirely. However they declined to answer my question because I’m not a premium user I paid money for the version of the app that I use, and as a paying customer I expect some level of support at least for simple questions. I’m not pleased that this developer has chosen to ignore needs of non-premium paid users. I found you could ask this question of their automated online chat bot, and you get an answer, it’s just an answer that is not true, and it directs you to take steps with features that don’t exist.
2/14/24 Update: I did receive a developer response in informing me that my Plus plan was discontinued nine years ago. I’m well aware of that. My point was, while the plan may have been discontinued, I still purchased the app and the developer has my money. It’s my feeling that there should be some “support” quid pro quo connected to that fact, otherwise the developer has simply stiffed a paid customer. Don’t get me wrong, I still love the app and will continue to use it, as it far surpasses anything it’s competitors offer. I just feel cheated on the Support issue, and I think others should be aware of that."
??HappyGoThankYou,10936231208,2024-02-13T18:31:26-07:00,5,Great as a quit nicotine aid that’s anonymous and only for you. I don’t journal usually but this helped in the quitting process and I’m enjoying it now.
macbookpro15,10934348008,2024-02-13T06:17:26-07:00,2,So I’ve used day one for the last 2 years and I have had a premium membership with them. Unfortunately the app quality has gone down over time with the app having a lot of bugs. This I understand to some extent however their support is very bad too. The turn around time for answers is over a week I have had several tickets with them and the answering took forever and at the end of the day their support engineers are just not equipped to do proper support. I literally figured out two issues on my own when their support was unable to help me one was with ordering a book and the other one was with the payment failing. In both cases doing a clean install and losing all the books I prepared fixed the issue. I think if they want to be around for a longer period of time they need to step up their game and go back to how they used to be.

The problem is resolved, I have access to my templates, and as promised, taking the review back to where it belongs.

Immediately afterwards, entry’s dating back years vanished. Fortunately, support team was able to assist me with retrieving them. I am now faced with the same occurrence, seeking assistance again. Would be awesome to never have to revisit this again."
Retirwneercs,10909836423,2024-02-06T13:21:06-07:00,5,"Love your app and using it forever. Can’t say enough good things about it, but I do have one issue I would like you to address and that is could you make the scrubber bar on the iPhone etc I noticed it’s white. Could you make it a color so it stands out more. I missed it for the longest time before I realized it was even there. Just saying. It’s great when you scrub and the date appears next to it that makes it supper easy to find a particular date. Thats really smart. Thanks for an exceptional app

Oh yea almost forgot…Is there anyway you could do the find function so it’s highlighted? Whenever you do a find for something you need to look through the whole entire entry to see where it’s at as it’s never highlighted in yellow etc like most apps do. Is that a possibility to change that? I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for your great work."
Geekgirl1971,10907585644,2024-02-06T00:20:19-07:00,3,I’m very disappointed and upset with this app. I recorded my first audio recording last night. Then I went through the written dictation and corrected the grammar issues and mistakes it made with what I said. A process that took me 20-30 mins to fix. I hit done and it appeared to save. A few moments later I realized my entire entry just vanished. I’ve looked everywhere on my account and found nothing. What is the point of using this app if it doesn’t store my recordings. And how do I get to the cloud part of the app that’s showing at the top of the page? I sent a message through the contact us area but no one has bothered to respond. I’m not going to pay for an app that wastes my time and efforts.

I used to be the biggest pen to paper journaler, but having the ability to include all my pictures makes this journal by far my favorite method. I love the ability to make multiple journals. At the end of each year, I love how they offer to bind them into a hard copy journal in such fun colors. I can’t say enough good things about Day One."

1,497 streak today. The app keeps getting better. Now I can look back on 4 years of memories. It has been an easy process for me. Every morning after I do my daily devotional I do my entry from what I did the day before. Having the pictures to look back on is priceless. It’s also a good tool to look back on when I got my oil changed in my truck or when I fertilized the yard, etc by using the search feature. Love the app!"

It really helps me I used to use just my Notes but now since it’s so organized this app it’s way better than my notes app on Notes app you had to scroll down, but for this app you can just press journal or whatever and it’s like so organized and you could press back into the past journals you wrote it’s awesome.

K1S2B3,10884593462,2024-01-31T04:37:30-07:00,5,"In conversation with a friend, I mentioned that I wished I would have kept track of trips and other fun stuff for my kids as they were growing up. I stated that another good friend has kept a journal since he was a boy. She told me… “It’s never too late to start!”

I started this journal that day, as a way of logging information for my grandchildren when they are older.  

Over the last 900 plus days, I’ve expanded how I use it to log a record of health related items.  I keep adding other things too.  Any time I have something that I think could be noteworthy, I log it.  For example something that might be useful in documentation of a legal matter or whatever.  

Lastly I make sure to log every day.  In addition to keeping track of my weight and exercise I’ve done, I’ve set a goal to actually do something during the day that is noteworthy.   Another way to say that is to make sure I don’t have to disappoint myself by stating that I didn’t do anything today!"

Edited to add Will use until my subscription runs out, maybe. Have had an issue with the template feature for over three weeks without a fix. The below goes into detail. I’m looking for a new app or may just use the new Apple journal. I have been using this app for over a year without issue. Recently the template tab has been functioning erratically. I have put in several tech support requests and gotten a canned response. I have tried all the suggested / usual fixes without success. Review could be five stars but poor support response after several requests is bad. I now see that Apple has added a free journaling app. I’m now looking at switching to that and not reupping my Day One app when the time comes."

amitag,10878300638,2024-01-29T10:37:06-07:00,3,It would be great if there were affirmations or daily quote of the day to help lighten the mood. Sometimes quotes trigger a deeper thought of self assessment. I wish the journal had more of a real journal feel with a book like interface.

Apple ecosystem at home, but at work we are window based. So when I have downtime, it allows me to let my thoughts flow while I have the environment of tech at my fingertips.

L Shax,10862657418,2024-01-25T07:11:04-07:00,5,"OK, I am not a big journal writer, but the Day One app has so many capabilities and is so easy to use that I just love it!

I keep a regular photo journal here where I put time stamped curated photos, and this can be done at the end of each day, or a month later when you have some free time or are home sick or whatever. I also use this to jot down some story about an event or day f I want.

On any given day, I will snap a few pictures of something that brings me joy to include in this journal. I don't need to worry if the photo is 'good' or if anyone else will like it. It is just for me!  When I go back through my phone camera roll, most days have something, and there are fond memories!

This is also great for journalling trips, etc. 

I also keep a private journal (both are private, but this one double-checks before showing any previews on my screen), and this is where I vent, complain, record frustrating experiences, etc. It is so much easier to move on from something if you have documented how it made you feel. This journal helps me move past this, but also allows me to go back and process as needed, and can be a helpful reference for therapy sessions. 

Oh, there is also a email option where I can type an entry into an email that will send directly into my journal. I use this for longer entries. 

I really like having a separate app for all of this to avoid feeling like it might be a Google or Apple product that I might feel stuck with later."

I use it for a day to day list  at the end of my day to remember daily events.  I use it for different workshops and classes I attend.  For poetry writing.  For a prayer journal.  I love the search feature.  I used to keep handwritten journals but then lost track of things I had written.  I do wish there was an easier way to transfer a document into a word document.  Other than that I highly recommend this journal.

It’s packed with features. Even if you don’t know what to write, there are handy templates and prompts to help you develop a writing habit. For me, it’s therapeutic and helps me work out things in my life through thought and documentation. 

I really can’t recommend it enough."

However, I cannot understand how they expect people to type a 1-2 page journal every day on their phone. This doesn’t make sense at all. Yes, the app is nice with lots of features, but there has to be a PC version, or at least a web version that does’t look like an 8 grader designed and developed it.

As of 12/4/2023, I still have the Basic membership. I reached out to Support multiple times for help and then later for a refund.

I use the premium version so I can make entries on my iPad, which I find easier to flow into typing with. But I don’t always have my iPad, I do always have my phone however. I journal on my phone whenever I don’t have my iPad, or don’t have the energy to sit down and type for ten minutes. I have always wanted to journal daily, but the lack of access to my physical journal everyday made that hard. Day One makes that excuse negligible."

Staring at an empty page and feeling the need to write something profound. Or journal prompts I found didn’t really resonate or inspire me. I recently found Day One and I’m addicted! It’s only day 6 and I already have 17 entries. The prompts allow me to explore and be curious. Even though I’ve reused journal prompts on different days, it’s never boring. Each day brings new opportunities and obstacles and so the prompts feel brand new. I cannot tell you how much this app has helped with my mental health and overall happiness. This is literally the second review I’ve ever written but I had to because it was so important to me. Download it!! You won’t regret it."

I tried fixing it by turning off the iPhone and even deleted and reinstalled the app a couple of times but that didn't work, then. 

I next contacted the apps help line and got a message back that my problem would be passed on to their tech people.

Today I tried again to make a new entry on the iPhone app and it still froze so then I tried deleting the app and afterwards turning off my iPhone for five minutes.

When I reinstalled Day One app on my iPhone and waited till after it synced with icloud downloading all my past entries I again tried to make a new entry and this time it worked!

I  guess that the apps tech must have been working on it so my deleting the app and reinstalling it this time worked,  so if you have the same problem try it!

I pay for premium and don’t know if I’d use it without all of the amazing features — I use it online for typing long updates but mostly I use the mobile app. I upload pictures, videos and voice recordings. I often dictate voice to text. I really like the ability to have multiple journals for different purposes. Does everything I need it to, and I feel a huge relief that I’m finally capturing the important details of life again. I’m now in my forties, kids range from elem school to college and ‘Grandmotherhood’ is even on the horizon now — eeek! I don’t want to miss out on keeping record of any more years."

UsefulReviewsNow,10764437988,2023-12-30T15:00:30-07:00,4,"The journaling concept is amazing. It meets all my needs and is by far the best free app of its kind. Unfortunately, there are a lot of drawbacks if you don’t choose the premium plan, which is roughly $36/year. For instance, if you don’t want to splurge on premium, you can not add videos or multiple photos into one entry. It is to be noted that you can add one photo per entry without premium. Also, there is no cross-device sharing without premium. You can’t start on your phone and end on your Mac unless you pay the price.

Overall, these don’t detract from an otherwise enjoyable journaling experience, but without premium, the line is thin between Day One and the standard Apple Notes app."

carrie3630,10759127176,2023-12-29T07:24:15-07:00,5,"I’ve been using DayOne for years and it just gets better and better. It is so easy to start a journal entry. DayOne is integrated across the iOS platform, so you can quickly send photos, articles, or inspiration from around the internet to your journal. The tagging and searching are top notch. You can even create separate journals for different projects or themes.

One of the best features is the location, weather, and activity logging that seamlessly integrate into new entries. When I’m out and about, I take a lot of pictures, but don’t always add them to DayOne the same day. When I create a new entry, I can add the photos and am immediately prompted to apply the photo date and location, so it keeps everything in order.

I love how the developer keeps making DayOne better. I know Apple has launched their own journalling app, but I’m committed to this wonderful app that has stood the test of time and is now a daily feature in my life."

Day One is a little different than Evernote, but just as useful.  I have almost 50 journals on various topics and time periods.  I use the app to keep track of my business and my nonprofit.  I take notes for the books I’m writing.  I use Day One to remember important things.  My entries often use pictures, videos, and audio files.  The whole thing is searchable.  It is my brain, stored on a handy device in my pocket.  For 2024, I plan to use Day One even more, recording notes and thoughts from almost every aspect of my life.  It is effortless to use.  I hope it remains just the way it is, for many years into the future.  One improvement I wouldn’t mind would be if the voice to text was a little more accurate sometimes.  It gets about 90% of the words right, and I can usually make the corrections pretty quickly.  I wish every app I use was this dependable, versatile, and useful."

This is incredibly useful to me in the mornings, when most of my ideas hit me, but I have very little time to write them down because I’m getting ready for work. This app allows you to record and leave it running so you can simply talk at your device when you have something that you want to write down. There are many incredibly useful features in here, but the transcription is the one that wins the day for me.

Additionally, Day One offers simple markdown support, enabling me to format my entries exactly how I want them. 
The inclusion of daily prompts adds a creative touch, sparking inspiration for my journaling journey. I particularly appreciate the ""On this day"" pop-ups that remind me of my thoughts and experiences from a year ago, giving me a chance to reflect and appreciate my own growth.

Its developers never listened to users and called us “vocal minority” when we asked for something THEY did not like. Removed all the great features from the app, photo stream was great once, now it’s no different from regular photo app, limited many features under subscription.

A password recovery email was sent, I followed the link, and it would open up a Chrome tab directly to my account.

Which means that someone would merely need to have my email and request an account recovery and have direct access to my day one account on Chrome.

As an extension, the password recovery would do as I have outlined above and to change my password I wouldn’t have to reenter the password that I forgot.

Lastly, when I go to speak with customer support or “contact customer support I don’t actually get to contact anybody. I am directed to the FAQs or their forum, which to post, and I need to sign in."
DrBarr,10695673556,2023-12-14T20:17:45-07:00,5,I use this application daily. You can create different categories for each type of your entries. You can add photos to your entries. You can edit or delete your entries anytime you want. You can “Pin” to entries that you wanna be sure you won’t forget. I am so happy that I found this application! This application is perfect!!!??

waldhaus1,10694366952,2023-12-14T10:55:26-07:00,5,The other question is handwriting vs typing a journal entry. Day One if more focused on the typed entry. Taking time to be self aware and examining one’s life can always offer satisfaction - takes some of the immediacy out of life.

My one suggestion would be the ability to create sections within our journals. I want to be able to separate my travel journal by each location"

I tried the recent apple journal, but at this time, there’s no comparison. I suspect though, apple might iterate to the point where dayone might start need to worry, even the paid version of dayone. 

But right now, dayone is still my go to journaling and most likely everyone else as well."

Now they just made the previous app unusable and replaced it with this new one so that they could get more money. Original app you paid once and you were done. Now they try to make you pay a monthly fee for “premium” to get basically the same thing as what I already owned. They don’t even offer like a curtesy credit for the users who had paid for the previous app. They didn’t do any of this to benefit the consumer. They did it to get more money. Why would I pay for a monthly subscription to write like I can on the built in iPhone notes app?! Ridiculous

Day One
iOS notes
Notebooks by Afons Schmid

I’ve whittled it down to two : 
 iOS Notes and Day One.

I’ve been using iOS notes for 15 years. I have used Day One in the past. But wasn’t satisfied with it. Then they did a super upgrade to it and it appears as though it’s a strong contender for the best Notes app. I’ve compared iOS notes with Day One feature by feature, capability by capability. So far Day One is  in the lead. But it’s close. I’ll post again when I’ve decided."

La Nikacia,10680633807,2023-12-10T19:21:51-07:00,1,"I got to the registration page and had the option of signing up with my Apple face recognition or email and password. My short term memory has been failing due to health issues which is why I wanted the app in the first place. 

Knowing that I’d inevitably randomly get signed out and get flustered and upset having to reset a password I wouldn’t remember, I chose to sign in with Apple. The app read my face and accepted it. Then…nothing. I could never get past that page even after the face scan recognized me every time. 

If just accessing the app doesn’t work correctly, how annoying is using it going to be? Deleting it right away. Disappointed, it looked fun and helpful."
SpiderKisses21,10674383659,2023-12-09T05:34:55-07:00,5,I would highly recommend this journal. You can have as many little journals as you want.

My phone is always nearby and usually in my hands.  It is so easy to jot down some thoughts and feelings whenever they arise. 

I looked at several apps and deleted all except this one.  I use it on the simplest level.   It has tons of features, but they are not intrusive.  Just there if I want them.  

The typing practice on my phone is an added bonus."

Lalit Mishra,10651625209,2023-12-02T20:41:29-07:00,5,"Day One Journal App stands out as a premier digital journaling platform, providing a seamless and enriched experience for capturing life's moments. Its interface is elegantly simple, inviting users to document their thoughts and activities without the distraction of cluttered toolbars.

One of Day One's most compelling features is its versatility. Whether you're a minimalist who appreciates the one-click entry system and clean design or a detail-oriented person who enjoys cataloging entries with metadata like location, weather, and music, Day One caters to all. The app's use of templates and prompts ingeniously lowers the barrier to journaling, making it accessible even when inspiration is scarce.

For those who like to journal on-the-go, Day One's multimedia capabilities allow for a rich recording of experiences, enabling users to add photos, videos, and even audio to their entries. The app also respects the private nature of journaling, offering robust security features to protect personal musings.

Customizable reminders are another innovative aspect, helping users build a consistent journaling habit by setting multiple prompts throughout the day, tailored to their schedule.

In essence, Day One excels not just as a digital journal but as a companion for life's journey, providing a versatile, secure, and user-friendly space to document personal growth, reflect on experiences, and store memories."

Lea Franco,10639849122,2023-11-29T15:30:37-07:00,5,"The over under:
Making a habit of using Day One has saved me time, lowered my anxiety, and saved me money. 
It’s worth the subscription. Get it. 

The longer version that ADHDers in particular will see themselves in and understand:

Losing time finding things, buying things you think will fix you but you never use, buying another of the thing you can’t find or forgot you already have, is the “ADHD Tax.” I’ve paid. 
(I personally consider losing writing, ideas, and pictures part of the ADHD tax.)  

Day One  is the first app (or physical book) I’ve ever used regularly. I did have to build the habit, but it wasn’t hard because Day One is effortless. 

I have many lovely journals. a couple bujos, planners, and the guilt from not using them. 
I used to have a lot of stuff “somewhere” and had to go on a safari every time I needed any of it. 

I use Day One for journaling, saving ideas for projects, corralling spicy social media drafts and angry emails safely away from that “send” button, cataloging stuff in bins, boxes, and baskets, venting, pet pictures, and checklisting.  
It’s a boss feeling when you think, “Where is the (insert thing  here)?” and I can look it up, see it’s in Bin 3, grab it, and get back to what I was doing. 
Day One has tagging so it’s even easier to find that #blue faux fur or tell yourself #Go Me. 

My one and only beef  is that Day One is a subscription instead of a purchase. I’d love a version I could buy and set to back up to Dropbox or my personal cloud storage. 
On the other hand, this year’s cost of using Day One is definitely less than an unused planner and replacing a jacket."

I have it on both my iPhone and iPad; I'm comfortable with the features and functionality and it syncs well with both devices. I'd be much more consistent in journaling if I was just able to access it through the internet with a desktop. I type much more fluently on a regular keyboard and using the devices forces me to type with one finger. I realize this is my problem, but other apps have websites that are accessible and I don't understand why this one isn't."

I thought to my self, if I were to drop this notebook in the water, I’d lose everything in here. That made me think, maybe it’s time to go digital. At least it would all be backed up. I’ll fast forward a bit~ I tried several different apps, and I landed here. This app allows me to have everything in one place, it allows me to add pictures, songs, and really anything! It plays seamlessly between my computer, and phone (I pad if I wanted) and the convenience is incredible. It tracks where I made the entry, and the time (I’ve always had an interesting fascination with starting my entries with the date and exact time I’m journaling because I feel it captures the moment in it’s entirety. I’m writing this review at 11:37AM). It even captures the weather, which I suppose isn’t important (to me) but a fun detail. Ok, I’m trailing here~ this app is amazing, and I suggest you find out the features for yourself! I’m a daily journalist and this app lets me categorize everything exactly as I need it. I can search, and reference things as needed. I couldn’t possibly be more happy with an app! Everything is backed up, twice, and you can get your journals printed if you want them on the shelf! I haven’t used this feature yet, but I know the time will come. I do miss the tactile feel of writing on paper, but for what this app offers, the pros heavily outweigh the cons!!!!! At times when paper is what’s available,  I find my self taking a picture of the entry and logging it into the app. HERE’S YOUR SIGN, MAKE THE SWITCH. I can, nearly, guarantee you won’t regret it! I like that i have the option to password lock the app, because this is for me, and only me. I could go on, and on, but I’ll end this here. THIS IS THE ONLY APP I HAVE THAT I CAN SAY HAS TRULY CHANGED MY LIFE. For how much I journal, and what this app offers, I will gladly pay the subscription price :) JUST DO IT!"

Day One is the place where everything comes together - all links (music, video, pdf, photos) bookmarks, accounting, reading, recipes, journaling. Give it a spin and find a central repository with security options for everything - an uncluttered running diary of life so you can get back to living it. Free up brain space for creative, enjoyable endeavors rather than searching for stored info across too many platforms. The tagging and multiple journal capabilities are the key to your freedom.

Update: a great app to store Freeform boards as pdfs.  

Syncing is seamless across the Apple ecosystem and love making audio notes and journals which can be AI transcribed."

Basic level no longer allows addition of a photo. With basic you can add a photo to an entry which has worked for me for as long as I have used the app (almost 8 years). The latest version of the app asks you to sign up for premium when you try to add the photo. Help pages are useless as you have to sign up for a Wordpress domain to use the forums. And then you can’t log in that way either. No way to contact support other than a chatbot which asks you, again, to sign up for premium. I really like this app but this is a step backwards."

kasia4484,10458147038,2023-10-09T23:24:27-07:00,4,"Improvement in Handwriting Experience

Rating: ????? (4/5)

I've been using the Day One app for some time now, and I must say, I'm a huge fan. It's an excellent tool for digital journaling, offering a plethora of features that make it stand out. The seamless integration with various media types, robust tagging system, and intuitive interface are all top-notch.

However, there's one area where I find room for improvement—the Apple Pencil experience. As someone who enjoys a more handwritten journaling approach, I was hoping for a smoother and more immersive experience. Currently, the app allows for drawing and basic writing, but it doesn't quite capture the essence of a true handwritten journaling experience.

I believe that a substantial update in this aspect would be a game-changer. If the app could enhance the handwriting capabilities to provide a more natural and fluid writing experience, it would undoubtedly elevate the Day One app to a whole new level.

While I started with the one-month free trial, I have reservations about extending it and purchasing the upgrade, primarily due to this reason. However, I'd be more than willing to become a loyal, long-term client if this particular feature is addressed in future updates.

In summary, the Day One app is fantastic, but there's a potential for perfection in the handwriting department. With some tweaks and updates, this app could easily become a five-star favorite for many, including myself.

Kasia"

DrFunk,10448471716,2023-10-07T05:29:34-07:00,5,"I saw a video where a photographer was taking two seconds out of each day for a whole year and put it together in a few minutes of a movie. The images went flashing by in high speed, but your minds eye could capture the moment, and it was a memory brought forward. Fascinating how a short  movie was able to remind you of the whole year. I was all excited and thought I needed to do this however, that’s a lot of editing! So I found this app and decided that using the dictation system on the iPhone, and this app, I would start to record, the salient features of each day. I felt like life is going by too fast so I needed to record it. That was in 2019. Boy was I right because since then we’ve had multiple years of Covid, death in the family, issues at work and a national awards that my daughter got, all recorded in it in this app. After losing my wife, I’m so glad I have images and jokes and things to remember her by. I started recording 4 years before her death and now wish I had done this at the beginning. The app works flawlessly and I will continue to do so. I record a little something and some photo of each day. The stuff I want to remember and even the stuff I want to forget because I don’t wanna do that again! I finally printed out five books by now, so I have them on paper on my shelf. Time is your most valuable asset and we don’t record the events very well, thinking that will remember it all. Looking back at the books I can tell you those books are priceless. Thank you Day One."

This deliberate chronicle, albeit digital, has its own set of new nightmares (e.g. losing brilliant drafts never to be recovered in this lifetime; 99 CENT pay wall hitting at that critical juncture where poverty and verisimilitude collide to disrupt the latest masterpiece with a Mephisto phenomenon option: or else!)

 I like the interface, platform, obvious intention & execution of this app. The ""interface"" to me means how I interact with the digital input of my thoughts and artist way type Journaling that I've been doing doe twenty odd years - so I want to pick up where I left off not have to adjust my creative process to some fraudulent fad, but rather seamlessly fold the ""platform"" which in this case is iphone app into my creative process. Which to some might be ""crazy"" or chaotic because I am highly creative. I don't want an application limiting the expression I have been honing over my 58 years on the planet. I appreciate the fluid format and ability to play with media within a post, love the fonts and am generally a huge fan. I went from premium at first to standard due to massive cuts in cash flow so all paid apps had to go until I could justify their value. I forsee at some point paying premium to complete an archive or print a thematic book. As a lifelong writer and photographer, a writer, Director and producer by trade and a storytelling maven by fate, I love this app and encourage writers or artist way type journal afficionadoes (those who use photorealism to convey their thoughts and emotions or visual poetry) out there to give it a try. It's pretty integrated so you can track your life archive across multiple tools and resources you already find useful in your digital dominion. I welcome the developers to set up.a forum for their loyal users to give more meaningful feedback. I'm genx and prefer contributing to projects that can best utilize my time investment. Cheers!

jujubee524,10419558849,2023-09-29T06:10:49-07:00,5,I’ve journaled in the past starting when I was in grammar school and continued after that — but not on a regular basis. Day One is part of my daily routine and I love everything about it! Helps me get set up for the day as I journal right after I’ve done my daily list. The prompts are sometimes exactly what I need but if not I just start journaling. Well done! And thank you!

I get lay/long photos, time and weather without needing to look it. Very handy for a sailing passage. I need to earn if there is a way to import old logs. Of have hundreds of days of logs in Excel."

First of all it’s better for your health if you keep a diary and this is my diary. Secondly, it helps me keep a perspective on a certain situation and believes my stress level.

I can also look back at certain things and see if I’ve progressed to some thing that I had discussed attaining earlier in my life."
elyshium,10414876089,2023-09-27T22:36:55-07:00,5,I’ve always been in love with writing but never stayed consistent when it came to journaling. This app has managed to keep me hooked and continue writing on my journal every single day. I love the templates and the options to add photos or additional things on the entries. I’m definitely keeping my premium subscription!
RoryGi,10413545329,2023-09-27T12:15:25-07:00,5,"Bug fixed, thank you!"
T0wanda,10413494223,2023-09-27T11:55:11-07:00,4,I suddenly had problems loading my photos into the app. I’m glad to know the developers knew of the issue and are getting it fixed. I’m back in business. So grateful!
robgen,10413382563,2023-09-27T11:11:40-07:00,4,"I used this for years and loved it. For some reason the app lost my sign in, and when I reconnected it had dropped my premium status although I had just paid for it. And since I’m dropped from premium, I lost priortity for support.

I did finally find a way to contact the developer and the responded though. Which is a big point in their favor."
ShazarK,10412755323,2023-09-27T07:34:11-07:00,5,"I’ve always been an avid user of apps that help to organize my thoughts and writing. Day One stand stands out as one the best. Use it to coalesce all your digital work into one place. It’s a scrapbook of thoughts and projects and ideas and feelings; it’s an app that allows me to explore my inner world and chronicle my outer life.

The best parts: it reminds me of journal entries I made on this date years ago; the export to PDF function; the ability to get a printed book of my entries (great quality, I use it often).

I rarely write reviews or I use apps for so long. I’ve used Day One for the past several years, and enjoyed it immensely. It’s the perfect tool for keeping a record of my life journey."

Needs to be usable on other platforms besides Apple (e.g., Microsoft). I would appreciate the opportunity to use on my laptop (SurfacePro)."

From the daily prompts, to the “streak” awards, the tool is built to inspire writing. My favorite feature is the templates and reminder system to encourage me to write."

I cannot add even a single photo, even though it says one photo a day can be added with basic. I liked the idea of seeing a calendar with photo memories. But it just asks me to download premium. The only thing I can do for free is write. There are other journal apps that offer way more for free."
marissahm,10400566520,2023-09-23T18:56:55-07:00,5,i have been using the app since 2016 and i love it. five years of memories ??

oilandlinen,10395820647,2023-09-22T11:08:46-07:00,4,I’ve been using this app since 2015. I absolutely love it and will continue to use it. The interface is intuitive and clean. What frustrates me are some of the changes. The voice to text tech changed a few years back and never caught up with where it used to be. Yesterday I tried posting multiple photos to one entry and I could not. This is hugely frustrating as much of my entries used to be photos. Now we can only upload one photo a day? I do not use a lot of the integrations that this app can access. I just use the basic tools. Wondering if more things will be removed like the photos.

Superstar98,10391842440,2023-09-21T08:00:22-07:00,5,I started using Day One sometime back in 2019. I love how easy it makes journaling rather than sitting down to write I can just pull out my phone and make a quick note or journal on the go. I love that even the free version is useful and it doesn’t limit the number of entries you can make. Such a great app- I highly recommend!
Sharon P.,10389079260,2023-09-20T12:17:26-07:00,5,"Day, one lets me manage my events, catalog, diary, food, log for my diabetes, it doesn’t have all that extra fluff I do not need. I’ve been depending on it I think for 10 years now."

BEA_000,10382002449,2023-09-18T10:58:39-07:00,2,"Guess my review was removed ...
I was an early user of this software and they kept ""updating"" to new versions and pricing in a way that didn't allow for previous data to convert and increased the price level substantially. It's hopefully pretty solid today, but I lost months of information, which totally defeats the purpose of keeping a journal. They only seemed concerned about making money and not the numerous inconvenient updates and difficult to apply patches."

diasapointedagain,10372089896,2023-09-15T15:00:39-07:00,1,This app does not deserve even one star. The idea is terrific but the execution is just awful. Lots of glitches which seem to get worse with each update. Probably time for new management and technologies.

Even though Apple is no longer supporting this phone, it really seems that a slightly older version would be available. Like the entry I made….oops, never mind. I can’t see the day I made that last entry, but it has been this year.

Let all who use this amazing, wonderful app to delineate your lives BEWARE. There was no warning that I would no longer be able to access my account. I think that I maybe could have downloaded my entries.

When will you become obsolete?"

With different templates and promote, I can easily write about the daily prompt and gives my brain time to process and eliminates writers block."
