"I mean preferably, don't. A few things can scratch the same itch (speaking from experience) like rubber bands snapped against the wrist, grabbing ice cubes with your bare hands until you can't stand it, submerging your face in ice water, holding your breathe as long as possible. What your mind is craving is stimuli and control, razors are not needed for that and having to deal with the scars in the future absolutely sucks.

But if you must, please be safe, keep your cuts shallow and sterilize the area and all your tools with  alcohol, make sure your hands are clean (fucking wash them COVID style), wash the wound afterwards with room temperature water and soap, then keep pressure on it until the bleeding stops. Apply an antibacterial ointment with a clean cutip or clean fingers, dress accordingly with gauze and tape if too large for adhesive dressings. Clean the wound and change dressing, reapply ointment daily, once healed, you can apply vitamin e cream to the scar to help fade it.

Preferably though, don't. Try the other suggestions I gave you, journal, talk to someone, take a walk, listen to loud music. Mental illness is an absolute bitch, whatever it's telling you, I promise it isn't true. You're a good person, you're worthy of love, and even if I do not know you I love you.

Please be safe."
"Simple is better. 

I do recommend having reflection moments like journaling. 

But yeah, I had that problem too with Daylio, I wanted to track every detail and that‚Äôs not ideal in the long term. Now I just go with the essentials."
"Genuinely, I like the feel of writing. It takes more effort and I believe it‚Äôs more thoughtful that way. I can‚Äôt deny that an online diary is convenient though. It just boils down to personal preference."
"i'm kinda running into the same issue now. i started using daylio 3 months ago, i was originally doing one entry at the end of the day with some general activities i did. then i started experimenting with doing multiple entries per day, tracking habits/attention/energy levels etc, largely bc i discovered this subreddit. but at this point i'm just not sure what should i be tracking and what is making the app too cluttered and which activities are worth writing down. i'm still figuring it out but i'm leaning towards not tracking habits and lifestyle bc i use another app for that. otherwise i'm overthinking things and i'm not sure what the purpose of the app is for me. this is what happens with so much customization available."

I don't journal. I have some entries, I rarely look back on them. I use it to remind myself to take medication and track my mood. I've got a reminder AM, PM, and late evening for a recap before bed. I try to save a picture of each member of my family every day. I've been trying out new things for years now. I used to have 15 moods. I used to track almost no activities at all. Now my activities are all kinda reminders of things to do and things not to do.  I've repurposed multiple times. I never stopped loving this app."
"I started using daylio 4 years ago. it was the first time I started journaling. I chose daylio at that time because I thought my life isn‚Äôt that colorful and I wanted to track when I am truly anything but meh. a year later the purpose of the app becomes just to clear my mind and revisit my memories when I feel bored. 

I usually write one entry at the end of the day, only writing whats important or how do I feel or what Im gonna do. If something interesting happened during the day I might write a quick entry, then write my usual daily entry later. I don‚Äôt use specific activities, my activity list is small and general, because for me, if it was specific or detailed it will be more complex and using the app will be a tiring task for me. for example, any type of activity that will make me breath heavily and/will push my body to some kind of physical limit is just under ‚Äúexercise‚Äù activity. 

As you said, its just an event tracker for me too, I like it tho. I did not use it to change any aspect of my life and I don‚Äôt feel that anything has changed, but I do believe there are other people who use it more purposefully."
"still learning how to use daylio, but it does help me be more mindful about my life..."
Yeah that‚Äôs true and I could see that also I wonder if they would‚Äôve eventually jumped on the alternative grungy sound of the 90s since AOR was kinda of going out of style by then so they would‚Äôve needed to adapt which would‚Äôve been interesting  it just seems like they just faded out because they were unable to adapt there sound I could just imagine grunge journey phase and then pop punk journey no doubt they could‚Äôve pulled it off
"i had a similar idea - i feel like it's more beneficial for me to track just wellness / lifestyle factors in Daylio (basically what you call foundational tasks). like, whether or not i smoked weed, had alcohol, went on a walk, journaled that day. i might use the habit tracking app for habits where i need to record skills, how many minutes i've done smth for, and habits that don't have an effect on my mood, they just need to get done."
It's your diary ü§∑ I'd set it up now and forget about it.
"Daylio creates daily backups automatically. I've got a couple of years of diary entries in there, why wouldn't you make backups? üôÑ"
After a month of using it (ish) are you still liking Bearable? My daylio I go through spurts of using it and wanting to restart my categories and tracking as I don't find the data super helpful.
Thank you! I appreciate your comment. I use to have dogs had to get rid of them :(. I do journal I journal last night actually told myself this is the time to practice emotional control so why not give myself an outlet after I wrote two pages I begin to feel better and decided to lay down and not allow the situation to effect my emotions but to acknowledge them and accept how I‚Äôm feeling and why I feel how I feel.
"Hey there! While Word files are a familiar and accessible option, there are some platforms specifically designed for journaling and long-form writing that might be a good fit.

One option to check out is MyAutoBio: myautobio.com. It's an AI-powered tool that helps you turn your life experiences into a cohesive and engaging narrative. It can be a great way to not only document your memories but also create a lasting legacy for future generations.

Of course, if you prefer the simplicity of Word files, that works too! There are ways to sync them between your PC and phone using cloud storage services like OneDrive or Google Drive.

I hope this helps!"
I use HabitNow for this. I use Daylio for tracking moods and limited journaling.
"No Daylio is a diary app, so that is not possible."
"Yes. That‚Äôs what I did. Make sure you actually back up the data (more, backup and restore,advanced,export) . It should be a .daylio file. Then import that into your iOS version."
Pen n paper for me! But I use daylio to track the habit that I logged it
"He‚Äôs occupied maybe u should take the Drugs from what u wrote I‚Äôd think your on drugs defs on drugs maybe u lie and manipulate maybe u use codes to grab my attention but maybe it don‚Äôt phase me like u waste your time maybe when I say ah I won‚Äôt get into that maybe the reaper is coming for all I hope that parts a joke but I know it isn‚Äôt maybe u would grow up maybe u would be a grown ass women /man maybe if I walk threw the door would u be scared or happy maybe I want to cut u up just to smile again maybe numbing takes all the excitement of pain just maybe it‚Äôs April fools and life‚Äôs but a shadow. A figment of our imagination and industrial pinging in your ear for life 
Of the untold pain that dwells only in for u are the problem only I can fix this for if I come here for advice u will never be whole if u come here for love I will never get love if u search for money u won‚Äôt receive if u search. Revenge u will not receive it 
Because April fools aside if your a fool everyday for being here looking for these things diary or no diary all these things come from hard work actions not words or typing from forgiveness for making that call not writing for showing up for not being here if u can‚Äôt live without him rock up to him use your words and actions or yes I will die alone because this app will never get u love"
Daylio is so customizable. I've made mine largely a tool for tracking my focus and productivity. My partner uses it for medical journaling.
"Dream after Dream... Must have to complete the set... I have it on cassette,CD and I have a framed album.... It was recorded in Japan during the escape tour in 1980... It is a different side of journey but beautiful"
"I write my journal entries in Google Docs or Notes then paste them from the mobile app to Daylio (: It's an extra step, but you can type on PC that way."
"You can buy a Bluetooth keyboard, connect it to your smartphone, and type long-form journal entries on Daylio: [Bluetooth Keyboard](https://www.amazon.ca/PINKCAT-Bluetooth-Keyboard-Ultra-Slim-Rechargeable/dp/B0BZSH1NDX/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?crid=3GCZVK18VF7JJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._NrlBGeBUhxu5TsoA_Pi0Emc6nbT3d1bj1y1sBBocKcabWmCTm-tKRiYOxOi8cONFoXOJp7_2RlvrcIJ-1vBnCwjrSjd0ZVP9EUcK0bxfoqpGSxmTqjJG6zsHCznqGigi3_v1laUcUyzEDPBzT5dRKMeDHf4yDrCS61pdUpV13lhnJLYYfKPiK-lR79WEtRSGz6yYKiYcLe166WHbGmHtw.jDyW5rKijzTXxLGsaA3WIp1XwOCERcH_XQ3AwLU523k&dib_tag=se&keywords=pinkcat+bluetooth+keyboard&qid=1710602774&sprefix=pinkcat+%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-3)"
"I just hope that someday daylio will support the web app / Windows app or anything that will allow me to use it on my laptop. 

In the meantime, diarium is amazing for journaling on pc and phone . Bear in mind that each app is like 7 $ or 10 $ one-time purchase separately priced, so you pay once for pc and then you pay for the phone . 

The free version offers a lot on its own. You might try it . The developer is also very cooperative . 

Other than that, you can use upnote or Joplin."
"I should've just said journaling I guess. I do these stream-of-consciousness entries in addition to logging events in diary form. Like if I log ""friend hangout"" with Daylio I usually write a short description or summary of how it went."
"I'm a bit confused, probably because I don't really understand what you mean by ""long form journal""...

I have been writing multi-paragraph journal entries in the ""notes"" section for years now... I don't see how daylio is at all incompatible with that?"
"reading this‚Ä¶after allowing my 13 year old to order an Osamu Davai book‚Ä¶has me questioning my own reality.

you, in fact, have not failed as a human being. you, in fact, have succeeded. a false reality exists online. you, my dear, are finding your way back to the real one. that path is a lonely one - but only for a little while. eventually, other humans, the ones connected to breath and air and life and ‚Äúhere‚Äù‚Ä¶the ones walking a similar journey‚Ä¶will cross paths within your own.

until then‚Ä¶hold on and keep writing.

always‚Ä¶keep writing."
"As someone who had to learn the hard way: persuing what matters to you, whether or not it works out, is never a waste of time. If the job ends up not being the right thing, it will be a necessary step on the journey to the right thing . And there‚Äôs still a good chance it is too: while there will be bad things you don‚Äôt know about yet, there will also be good things you don‚Äôt know about.¬†

The one certainty in life is nothing is ever exactly what you‚Äôll expect it to be. Your dream image isn‚Äôt true, but neither is your nightmare. And neither is the ‚Äúin between‚Äù of those two. You can‚Äôt build the truth on your own. You‚Äôll have to discover it- and the adventure in seeking it is as important as finding it. It‚Äôs easier said than done, but try to learn to value the journey just as much as you do the goal.¬†"
"this also got me thinking, what way would you want the biopic/doc to swing? like a steve perry or neal schon origin story and how they got into the scene, or would you start at the beginning of journey and go through the different eras of journey through time? the journey of journey? üòÇ"
"LITERALLY!!! i feel like journey made such a big footprint in music and we‚Äôre missing such a big part of the music scene memoirs/biopics without journey in there üò≠ and i know at least for me the elvis biopic got me into his music, think of how many more people could actually get into journeys discography and not just their top hits"
yes!!!! journey really needs something like that
"THIS!!!!!!! I‚Äôve seen the Arnel doc (which is awesome) but would love to see something about journey in their prime with Steve. I feel like a lot of footage is lost (meaning not on YouTube) and I want their memories to keep living! 
There are a couple docs in the 80s floating around but their quality isn‚Äôt great (understandably)"
I often find When You Love A Woman gets people hooked. I‚Äôve turned a few journey-haters to at least Journey-tolerators with that one. But Separate Ways always gets me going.
Okay thank you it‚Äôs my diary though dude don‚Äôt really need critiquing of diary
"This is true I have a diary entry on the individuation fetish of the West and how toxic it is beginning with having babies scream in terror in the other room to ‚Äúsleep train.‚Äù That is so bat-s crazy. We aren‚Äôt designed to live that way at all. Have a little perspective, look around the world, take a look at human history, listen to what your body is telling you as a mom in those instances. But ‚ÄúWell, this is what they say‚Äù wins the day."
"Getting very hard to love the app since the last 6 updates. I liked it because it was a very simple no fluff mood and activity tracker. 

I liked it because it was a easy way to track my medical symptoms, various anxieties, along with moods and activities. No need for pictures, diary etc etc etc etc.

Perhaps they should add a feature to disable things in the app so that the app can be what it was like 3 years ago."
"I am sorry to here that. I hope things are getting better! I started to journal actually because I started a relationship, and I wanted a place to have all my feelings written down. So it definitely makes me smile looking back at older memories ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"You probably can't turn them off directly, but if you use an app called [Buzzkill](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=buzzkill&c=apps), you can filter those out to auto-dismiss. for example, ""Search notifications from daylio with the word Premium"" and it'll dismiss.

I use it for many apps to get the notifications I want, and filter out the junk (insta and the like that bombard you). Well worth trying it out!"
"Hmm that's quite sad thanks. So far real alternatives I found , with cross device sync , are journey...but they seem quite shady"

"You can't use the same Daylio 'account' on multiple devices. 

The only way to do this would be to import/export back and forth on a regular basis but that's honestly not going to be worth the trouble.

"I had an iPhone. Now I have an android phone and an iPad. When you install the app it log in automatically on your OS account so I have 2 accounts on daylio. I want to use just one account (but i couldn't find a way to log out), or link both apps. At the moment, or i use it on android or ipad, and it's a mess to keep exporting every time"
"When I first tried daylio out a few weeks ago, it offered $11.99 a year or something, but only for a day, then it went to the $17.99 sale.

I opted for the lifetime though. I had a $10 off that was expiring soon from other offers.

If anyone is interested, I also tested out their nutrilio and after I started using it a day or so, it offered a lifetime for $14.99 but only for 2 days. I took advantage of that too."
"ayyy i am glad your journals are intact! it must've been such a relief, i'd add entries in the days i haven't added yet to keep the streak going if i were you!"
"I'm a bit confused so let me try to clarify.

You had one daylio account/backup on your iphone and one (separate) one on your iPad.

Now, you one to get the backup from your iphone onto your android phone? is that correct?

To do so, you should be able to go to Backup & Restore > Advanced Options > Export > Send the exported file to your desired device > Download daylio on your desired device > Backup & Restore > Import > Select the file you exported from your original device.

I believe that should work"

its super hard to get a hold of your mental health when pain hits, i know.. am going thru something similar, but you know what, daylio has helped me even now, i see how bad i do mentally thru daylio and i challenge myself to have good entries cause it could always be worse and also it helps me trick my mind into believeing that its not sooo bad even if it is.i know that philosophy and stoisim go out the window when the pain hits but realize that your mental health goes down when you try to control something you have no control of

anyhoo, keep dong daylio and understand there will be good days and there will be awful days, its life but dont loose hope, hugs"
"It's from some interview with Perry.

That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm doing. You posted your letter anonymously on a social media platform for other people to comment and respond to. If you didn‚Äôt want that to happen then get a fucking diary and keep it in your nightstand. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"Well my person sent me your diary entry so I thought it was written by her for me. She‚Äôs really the one who caused her own pain.

Sorry for your pain."
"Uhh...my dude. Who dumps out their personal story in response to a personal diary entry? You weren't responding to my pain. You wanted someone to listen to you, which was a lot and made me uncomfortable (which is what I use lol for). 

And yet I still wished you the best. Take a look in the mirror."
"I am not a professional but I do have some background knowledge and education. This doesn't look (to me) like bipolar disorder. Generally, mood cycles (mania/hypomania and/or depression) last much longer.

Clinically speaking, mania is 4-7 days (or longer) and depressive episodes are two weeks or longer. 

Your mood chart seems to go up and down on a much more frequent (almost daily) basis which seems more consistent for someone with a combination of depression and anxiety. 

Best of luck as you continue your mental health journey!

"suzanne was my most played song on spotify 2 years ago. one of journey‚Äôs most underrated songs, ever. imo.

steve perry has a solo song called ‚Äòmelody‚Äô .. so that‚Äôs another name he uses. melody is so underrated as well."
"I know this comes super late, but I just remembered something very important (at least it's for me) and I wanted to share. 

If you have to decide which emotion to select for an entry, be honest to yourself, ask yourself thrice if the emotion you want to select is really appropriate. 
I for example had (and still have) a problem with making things ""better"" than they were.

Example: Went to work, did my time, got home. All in all, it was okay. Nothing good, nothing bad. But because nothing bad actively happened, I'd mark it as ""good"". 

Even if something was bad, I'd then mark it as ""okay"". That's why on my graph you basically only ever see days being an average from ""okay"" to ""good""/""very good"". ""Bad"" days are very very rare and I've never had a ""very bad"" day on daylio. Despite this I'd say that a lot of days are really shitty. They should be marked as ""bad"" or worse but because I usually just tell myself ""nah, it was alright, not a big deal (etc.)"", they don't get appropriately marked. This gets worsened by the fact that my 3-5 entries a day kind of dilute any strong emotions (just getting up from bed has the same weight as being tortured for 6 hours if both are just one entry). 

Tldr: you can exaggerate your emotions on daylio to get a better picture how you really felt on the graph, especially if you do multiple entries a day"
"If it‚Äôs a really big one. Then the enormity of it will scare anyone and push them into procrastinating.

If it‚Äôs a long journey. Mark some milestones in between and celebrate or treat yourself when you reach those milestones in the journey. That way you will be able to stay focused and on the path for ultimate destination."
"Well don‚Äôt whine but still stand up for yourself and have boundaries. You whine for a reason because you feel something is inadequate or unfair. Be true and honest with yourself and explore positive ways to maturely and appropriately convey or deal with your grievances. There are other positive yet assertive ways. It‚Äôs all about putting the mind first and understanding it before emotion and that‚Äôs not easy to do for some of us. For me sometimes I hold it in and  I go find a private place where I‚Äôm alone and can‚Äôt be heard and pull an HRH Collection and just bitch out loud to myself (and use that I‚Äôm talking to my dog as cover
If I‚Äôm caught) or come here and vent or Reddit, maybe doing something like that or a diary or journal or private blog would help you find balance but don‚Äôt dive too much into negative feelings or thoughts. 

I have bipolar disorder and highly protective and guarded when it comes to privacy and we will go nuts if we feel like we‚Äôre being watched and monitored because sometimes the extremes or behaviors are bad but enjoyable or make sense to us so I tend to strive to be invisible and go with the flow no matter what so others can‚Äôt focus or make much judgement on my behavior or reactions but I feel like expressing yourself but learning how to put it in perspective can help you grow and handle things better.

Another thing I find helpful is even when your chips are down or going through a challenge is to take a look around you and find gratitude if you got a roof over your head, food  and water in your belly or easy access to, a person or people around or close to you who still love and support you and the health you have, because those are the basic needs of a human being but not all of us on this planet are fortunate enough to have these things. I feel like when we become used to having so much we become bored and and unsatisfied and tend to nitpick at things that aren‚Äôt actually important."
That's awesome! So happy for you. Wish you the very best on your journey through life.
Thanks for the journaling tips! Tagging and summarizing seem handy. I relate to the mental health boost‚Äîgonna give it a shot!
"You‚Äôve done a great job staying consistent this month! 

I‚Äôve been using Daylio for about 5 years now. My main uses of the app: track my goals, seeing how different activities affect my mood, and easy journaling to get shit off my mind. Think about what you want to use this app for. 

Disclaimer: I bought the app way back so I have the full version. I don‚Äôt know what the free version has or doesn‚Äôt have. (Yes, I do think it‚Äôs worth it to buy and no I don‚Äôt know how much it is these days unfortunately.)

My tips: 

Stay consistent! It‚Äôs the most valuable thing about the app. Keep putting check-ins each day. Use the reminders. Daylio reminds me three times a day (morning, mid day, before bed). I try my best to check in right after I do something relating to my goals or out of the ordinary (after a workout, after hanging out with a friend, after having alone time, etc). 

Put in all the feels. When I first started, it was hard for me to put in an entry when I wasn‚Äôt feeling anything other than good feelings. It skews the data as you can expect. Someone on this sub told me they do their emotions 1-5 instead of specific emotions (i.e. afraid, elated, sad, etc). I like this in terms of raw data and I don‚Äôt get stuck on naming the emotion. 

Group your activities. This will make it easier to utilize many of them when doing an entry. For example, I have groups for hobbies, weather, location (work, school, home, outside), people involved (SO, friends, coworkers, family, alone time), workout type (running, swimming, yoga), body events (period, bloating, etc), sobriety, etc. Whatever you feel is important will work for you. I found it overwhelming when they weren‚Äôt categorized. 

Use the goals. Seriously. I love them. I use them for cleaning the house (i..e tidy house 3x a week), going to the gym, and sober days (trying to quit smoking weed). It‚Äôs valuable to see this data in an easy to read format (check marks on a calendar). That being said....

Have your goals also be an activity. I find it's a bit difficult to see clearly how a goal correlates to a mood so I have them as both (checking off the goal for the day and clicking it as an activity in an entry). As an example, I have an exercise group with swimming, running, etc. in it and a location group that includes the gym or being outdoors. When you look for ""Influence on Mood"" in the monthly stats, you can click the activity (or the whole group) and it'll show you that data compared to when you don't have that activity. You can't quite get the same data with just having them as goals. 

Put in important days! Daylio will tell you exactly how many days since the event. I mostly use this to track medications I‚Äôm on. Also, it will send you reminders for birthdays and such. 

Add pictures. The visual component makes looking back on entries more fun :) They used to not have this feature and I‚Äôm glad they added it. 

OK that‚Äôs all I can think of! When it comes to everyone‚Äôs tips, take what resonates and forget about the rest. The primary tip is just to use it!! Put in those entries each day and you‚Äôll definitely feel satisfied seeing those monthly and yearly statistics. 

Welcome to the club :)"
"I have been doing daylio for 4 years now.
Really the most important things will just come with time - you'll realize after your first year what you wish you could know, what you wish you had tracked.

For me, it's been useful to look into the future and ask myself what I would want to know about my life.

To give you some examples, I track any health issues I have, I track social outings, physical activities, how I commute, where I go (e.g: school, work, store, downtown, etc), and some key life events (e.g: exam, big drama, near-death or dangerous experience).

Look at the statistics that daylio gives you and think what is might be cool to know about yourself a year from now."
"it was $80 Canadian, so far its been good, I think it'll be something I use in the long haul cause I like the idea of journaling but could never really get behind it as there was no analytical part to it, Daylio fixes that."
"This is really cool! I've just been dipping my toes into Obsidian, so I bookmarked your scripts as a way to visualize my data.

I was wondering if this technique would work to do monthly imports of data from other services into daylio or nutrilio apps. (E.g. Weight data from withings, exercise from Strava, sleep metrics from (?)RescueTime.)"
"Yeah daylio definitely helps with showing you that not every single day of your life is miserable, its still tough though"
"why can‚Äôt this night go on forever‚Ä¶. 
suzanne ‚Ä¶. 
when I think of you

so so so many journey songs don‚Äôt get the recognition they deserve/ed"
"I have a lifetime subscription to both and I'm very happy with it. I used to track my food in my daylio and while that was fine, nutrilio keeps it much more organized. It lets me track stats I care about like calories per meal and for the day and makes nice graphs of calories or weight. Also lets me make custom things like how bloated I am or how fast I'm eating, etc.

I think it's worth it."
"For me, the journey ended when they moved on without Steve. His voice brought me to the band. His singing is magic and medicine to me. I‚Äôm grateful for every song he‚Äôs recorded and the delight he took in performing them.

I‚Äôve come to accept though, that the chance to see him perform live is sadly gone, not that I begrudge the man his peaceful retirement at all! That said, if he decides to spend a week or two in Vegas I‚Äôll be first in line to sell my soul to be there. In the meantime, my downloaded playlists and videos make me smile(mostly), and sing(always), and cry(sometimes) and will do so until the day I die."
"In a few days, Steve Perry will turn 75 years old.  No way, no how he could tour and hit those notes, night after night, in the original key. 

I love Steve Perry.  However: If we want journey, it‚Äôs going to have to be with someone else singing lead at this point."

"Hi, i'm new to Daylio as well and love the app and all the activities you can add. I don't think you can add a separate journal entry or note without a mood. I wish this was possible too, for me it's more to timestamp events or when i take certain meds without having to add a mood every time, as i like to select only one mood or maybe two moods per day.

But what you could do is make a new group called ""hand tremor"" and add severitiy options like ""none"", ""some"" or ""severe"" or more, as activities to track in that group, and then remember to select one every day. And you could make a goal to have ""none"" x times a week or month or something like that. Then in the month overview you can select the severity you tracked and see how many days you had none or severe tremors. Hope this helps."
"Yoo, yes I did. I do think that I could leave without the premium subscription, although, if you have the money to spare you will find some features that will make it worth it. I do have been using a lot of the special dates and the goals feature. If you have an iPhone you can try to use their journal feature which is available for free."
"Probably not the best answer, but here's what I did : 
I installed a very very simple and clean app habitkit or ezhabits both are good for tracking my sleep in pixels. 

I know you want to do it in daylio, but hope this helps anyway."
"yeah..i was wondering why they didn't include it in daylio, it's quite a handy tool"
you‚Äôre able to do this in nutrillio but unfortunately not daylio. it‚Äôd be a cool feature
"Unfortunately, Daylio is not designed for computers. 

You have a few options:  
1. convert the pdf to word or text - there are hundreds of online converters for free - just google and choose one  

2. [https://faq.daylio.net/article/17-i-would-like-to-write-my-entries-on-a-computer-is-it-possible](https://faq.daylio.net/article/17-i-would-like-to-write-my-entries-on-a-computer-is-it-possible)"
"If you want all of the data, you can extract the data from the backup daylio file that is created when you go to ""More > Backup & Restore > Advanced Options > Export""

If you're on linux you can use this script I use for converting the backup file to json
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    set -e
    
    function main() {
        local input=""${1:?requires an input file}""
        local new_file=""${input/%.daylio/.json}""
    
        unzip -p ""${input}"" | base64 -d - | jq . > ""${new_file}""
        echo ""Written to: $(readlink -f ""${new_file}"")""
    }
    
    main ""$@""    

Alternatively, you can do it manually:

1. The daylio file is just a zip file, unzip it
2. This gives you a base64 encoded piece of data
3. Use a base64 decoder and it will give you a json file for you to work with"
"i had the same problem, i didn‚Äôt always feel just one emotion, and it wasn‚Äôt always so black and white. sometimes im feeling bad but more in a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù way. sometimes i felt ‚Äúmeh‚Äù in a bad way. i ended up creating an activity group of emotions (happy, good, average, meh, bad, depressed) and i would reccomend doing the same. didn‚Äôt make things complicated at all, just made it easier to express my emotions in daylio"
"Honestly this looks solid. Also less than 10 euros is a much much more reasonable pricing for a diary app. 

:)"
"Honestly I would go for it, even though it's costly but it is a lifetime payment, I hate subscriptions and I think subscriptions would cost more than a lifetime payment. The upside to getting the premium is that the Daylio Team is active in updating  and adding new features to their app. And then you have a good amount - or flexibility in customizing your journal/diary and tracking habits. I've tried out a bunch of journal/diary/habit apps and none has done it for me other than Daylio. I keep coming back to Daylio so I decided to get the lifetime."
"Thx. For now I decided not to buy it. Looks like the free version is good enough for me. Also I'm not ready to pay 40 euros for a diary app + knowing that the price used to be 3 euros. Total scam, biggest crazy inflation I've seen"
Yes I use it as sort of a diary as well as mood tracker and add a couple of photos each day.
"You're tracking mood swings, so try to definitely do more than one.

I personally don't have any mood disorder nor any symptoms/triggers that I need to track since I'm just using the app as a journal/diary so I'm doing only once a day. Used to do more per day but I didn't like how all my graphs just averaged out in the middle since from experience it's exceptionally rare for a day to be ""rad"" from morning until evening."
Mostly positive. Being happy is helping to create the habit for journaling (less than two months)
"Same. I‚Äôm just shy of 600 days, I log my mood (or feeling, or whatever we want to call it) 4-8 times a day, sometime more. Ultimately what I‚Äôm after is:

1. More self awareness of how I‚Äôm feeling and what might be correlated 

2. Better moods 

3. Habit tracking 

4. An informal journal


Logging how I‚Äôm feeling several times per day provides a bigger, more accurate, and ultimately less subjective dataset versus logging how I feel at the end of each day. This approach helps me to accomplish the goals I use Daylio for, but ultimately I guess it depends on each person‚Äôs goals and how much they‚Äôre willing to be on their phone"
"Mostly mood and activities, but I've started to use it for Goals and light journals using the Notes feature."
"I use it for mood and journaling. I have a lot of activities set up that up until now it has been useful as reminders for good habits. I haven‚Äôt had any aha moment when looking at activity-mood correlation. But the journal part has been amazing for reflecting on the year. I love the yearly stats, seeing the colored dots for all months in one graph.

Creating custom moods has helped me develop my emotional intelligence and be more mindful when writing my journal entry."
I send mine to my psychologist every week. So for me it‚Äôs primarily a journal logging things that happen. I have dissociative amnesia so this means my psychologist has a better idea of what‚Äôs going on in my life than compared to if I don‚Äôt journal. I also have alexithymia which makes it really tricky to actually track my moods.
"Hello, the lifetime purchase should never expire. Are you using the same Google Account? It looks like you‚Äôve been subscribed to some subscription. Maybe you‚Äôve started a free trial? The best way is to contact our supoort at hello@daylio.net

Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôll send us proof of purchase we will figure it out."
"Maybe u/stevomit can say something about this. 
But I thinks it's a bug. You can write a Mail at hello@daylio.net"
"this is why I stopped doing daylio lol, I was doing Normal and then I just completely flatlined."
I do this too! I actually started using Daylio bc I couldn‚Äôt get myself to fill out a DBT ‚Äúdiary card‚Äù so my therapist recommended Daylio & I‚Äôve been using it as such ever since. Before each weekly session I just export a weekly report and text it to her via iMessage. It‚Äôs super easy & I‚Äôve done it so many times my phone pulls her contact up first right away.
"sending you some strength! for me daylio helps me remind myself that things were good and will be good again, hang in there"
"So the issue is that the CSV doesn't distinguish *goals* from other activities that aren't flagged as goals? If so, I think you should be able to make them stand out in the export without *too* much extra work.

You could turn the CSV into an XLSX, then use conditional formatting to highlight cells that contain any of the activities you turned into goals.

To make this easier, you could add a special character to the descriptions of those activities. For example, I have some activities that I need to stand out in the export, so I've started the names of those activities with a ‚òÖ symbol.

With that, I use conditional formatting to highlight any cell containing ""‚òÖ,"" and boom, my goals stand out in the data. You can also use a formula to count those occurrences, like...

*=COUNTIF(D5:D10005,""‚òÖ"")*

...which should give you a total of all the occurrences of ‚òÖ in COL D, for example.

Hope that helps.

But mostly, I was just commiserating that for as fantastic as Daylio is *as a mobile app for bullet-journaling and mood tracking*, it's less than stellar when it comes to using that information outside of the app itself."
"I aim for a whole day feeling, but it is heavily weighted towards I'm feeling at the moment. I pay very little attention to the statistics beyond an occasional ""huh that's neat."" I think the primary value of Daylio is as a habit tracker and journal, so take my usage as you will."
Please try to restart your device and contact us directly at hello@daylio.net if the problem persists.
i have newest version of daylio and ios and it works for me
"I‚Äôm personally ok with paying for the yearly subscription because I see immense value in how the tracking has already improved my life

My goal is to have one app that I‚Äôll be using for years to come with ability to backup the data and export it out so I can keep it somewhere if the app ever shuts down, I‚Äôm about 1.5 months into daylio and liking it but unsure if I should make the switch

Was hoping that anyone with more experience using the two apps here can guide me in the right directiob"
"If i could upvote this 1,000 times i would. This was extremely helpful! I have kinda started on something like with a little bit of all of that last month I started using bipolar uk i find it very helpful in realising what part of the pattern i am in even more. I have transferred some of that data to daylio and used a system something like that from the last commenter who had an idea something like yours, but you went above and beyond with your in-depth process :)"
"Their debut album is great. I do love ‚ÄòNext‚Äô. The song Spaceman takes me on some kind of journey,  pun intended. The title track off of Look Into the Future is one of Journey‚Äôs masterpieces. They‚Äôre all great"
"'Twas cool, no?  The encore setlist included ""Of A Lifetime,"" which set off a mass exodus.  It was reminiscent of the ""Jazz Odyssey"" scene from *This is Spinal Tap.*

They redeemed themselves with an incendiary ""Black Magic Woman,"" joined by Steve Lukather."
Make sure to give raised on radio a listen. My personal favorite journey album ü§ü
"He will not. 

The man turns 74 year old in two weeks.  I saw him on his 45 birthday for the solo theater tour and he sounded amazing, but struggled with the really high stuff.  

He‚Äôs not going to subject his body and voice to the nightly rigors of those songs.   He left journey because the touring got to him.  That was in his 30s. 

Steve gave us some amazing music but he‚Äôs not coming back to tour."
"Only in our dreams kids, but [Rolie may make an appearance.](https://consequence.net/2023/01/gregg-rolie-journey-tour/)

I'd rather see Perry & Rolie together but no one consulted me about this."
[Yep but so is Gregg Rolie.](https://consequence.net/2023/01/gregg-rolie-journey-tour/)
Yes. Midjourney + Vinyl Record Mock-Up + Vinyl Sleeve Textures + Photoshop Editing
Looks like [Ebay for the DVD](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&_nkw=don%27t+stop+belivin%27+everyman%27s+journey+DVD&_sacat=0) is your best bet.
I hate this journey cover band but I‚Äôd go see them if Gregg came back
"They sell out arenas behind the journey name.  They could add more songs from Infinity and Evolution.  

He isn‚Äôt selling out arenas now.  And the OG fans would come out in droves."
I wasn‚Äôt there but I was on the AOL board for journey in like 1993-1994
"So do people search ""journey"" & think this sub isn't about the band Journey but about their life journey or is this just another spambot?

Reporting & blocking either way."
Pretty sure if you do a search on Wayback Machine for journeytheband.com you can get on the boards still. I remember doing that a few years back. I'll check out your forum for sure.
this is the wrong sub for this. this sub is for the american aor band journey.
"Seeing you‚Äôre other posts, this sub is for the band, ‚ÄúJourney,‚Äù not the act of pursuing a journey.

Probably a bot."
"Early journey was pretty rocking.  Check out the first five albums or so.   As far as from the Steve Perry days, check out Any Way You Want it, Separate Ways, Escape, Stone in Love, Dead or Alive, Keep On Running, Lay it Down, Edge of the Blade, and Be Good to Yourself. 

There are many others but that‚Äôs a good start.  Neal Schon‚Äôs guitar is rocking and you should listen to the above to really experience it.  "
"When I bought them, the tickets said 6:00pm for the start time, and all the information online that I could find agrees with that time. hat said, apparently [Foreigner are ALSO playing](http://dothebay.com/events/2018/9/21/journey-def-leppard) in this concert, so I have no real idea. I think the concert starts at 6:00, Def Leppard starts 7:00ish(?), and Journey later (8 or 9 I guess) I don't really know at this point, but I dont think it could be earlier than 6:00, thats what the ticket says, and I can only guess on the actual schedule for the bands.  I'm wary of taking BART bc of the schedule confusion, the concert could go late after BART closes, but MUNI should still be running. Hope you have a good time! :)"
Hey wassup guys so this one right here it's my cover of don't stop believin by journey . Alright so just a little favor right now . I'd actually like to c if I can get an opinion on this one if u could . Thanks ;)
"Being digital is not new for India. Though the journey towards e-governance started since 1990's, it was fully taken into the next level only by the new Digital India programme by Government of India. Unlike earlier plans, this humongous project is being envisaged to offer its citizens advanced online facilities. It anticipates to transform the country into a digitally empowered society, thereby bringing our country on the global digital map."
